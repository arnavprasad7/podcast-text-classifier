22,people are not mark wahlberg apparently mark wahlberg brings out the,twist,new superhero team is the happening because the happening is just a
23,worst, a midnight shyamalan,thing in the wind that makes people just go wild and do bad stuff and its sort

30, hell yeah he did i thought you were a shyamalanamaniac, laughs,hellevators in it remember he made a hellevator movie and that was kind
31, in the year of our lord 1999 he did the sixth sense he, okay wait on the one hand it is weird but on the other hand,of the last one where he was like let me just get in there make a hellevator
32,wrote shes all that he wrote stuart little and then hollywood was like,free jewelry box and cutting board,movie and we were like i think its done bud
33,good year good year please have the next 20 years on us, its a board, where you expect it to be different but then its something else
34, my name is midnight shyamalan laughter m is for mid, that is going to get food in it though and thats a problem i, wait why
35, this is the end of it this is the last film in the trilogy,guess ill clean it, what
36, the trilogy of films this is the third one i got sad to hear that its, i would say though you cant say like giving a present to, did he write those films
37,a trilogy but then i got happy again wikipedia says that he said hes open,someone you dont know is bad cause santa claus, laughs i didnt expect his career to have a shyamalan twist in it
38,to making another one if he gets a good idea, laughs, laughs so im going to be in this theater fucking op if they do
39, i guess he has become seasoned with age and will wait to make, oh i have a great solution question asker set your dad up with,a midnight showing im in here ive gotta know ive gotta know
40,a movie until he does have a good idea which i think is good and,an etsy shop say something like dad youre giving all this stuff away for, i must fucking know
41,inspiring,free let me set you up ill post the pictures ill take care of this for you, absolutely midnight shyamalan
42, im sorry i thought we were going to talk about m, like that way if your dad wants to give stuff out he still could, i feel like we were mean and now we should just go on
43,night shyamalan some more,but he could include a business card with a link to his shop and say tell, sure
44, just loading the cannon for another great m night shyamalan,your friends about this that way its not as weirdly personal, fuck yes
45, i like more of his films than i dont like and i feel like that, shark cuban here i already have invested in a website called, his career is kind of like that old cast iron pan that you got in
46,might have gotten lost in translation hes taking big swings,free the bees which is all about getting the bees out of prison so far so,your drawer and youre not supposed to wash it but its got a little bit of
47, come on now,good as far as i know there arent any bees in prison so its going well it,happening in it but it still has that sixth sense spice in it
48, i know that even he would have looked at the happening and,was a good investment i think this brings me to i am a fan of bees i, so im wondering if freddy rodriguez and his one big strong
49,say this one i dooked,did kind of zone out for most of your presentation i assume it does,arm from lady in the water is going to be in it
50, on this one is dookie this one is a dookie for me theres a w,include bees, just the arm his one big strong hey lets do some questions
51,column theres an l column and theres no shame in ending up on, well i did say that thing about shark cuban i dont know, sorry were you loading up the cannon juice
52,either one of those columns but there is another column to the right of,how much, well go ahead and blast that shit i dont want you to get a
53,the l column that is the d column,justins laughing,sticky cannon
54,thats for films where you dookied listen weve dookied a few episodes, i dont know how much more you want fr you want me to, come on now
55,i hear it i think even midnight shyamalan would say i dookied the,make two jokes, watching spencer breslin get absolutely fucking bodied with
56,happening the lemon drinks thing the whole actually all the bits of it, oooooh,a shotgun in the fucking face
57, that picture that picture though, laughing,laughing
58, sorry it was just really good, i dont know why the phrase i think ill puke it sounds like, so uh hey whats up next
59, my dad is a proficient woodworker hes retired so he spends a,you just opted for something off a menu, yowza
60,lot of time in his workshop but he rarely builds things for himself hes a, i have a real problem with this that you didnt go with canus, yeah yeah yeah
61,very generous man and loves is this your dads grindr page or like a,canine anus thats clumsy canus, yeah i mean you cant argue with that trav free stuff is free stuff
62,question he loves building things as gifts for people however he, how come them not me,is free stuff and we love it in this country the giving a jewelry box to a
63,sometimes goes overboard and builds things for people he barely knows, weve seen van wilder yeah,person you dont know is the strange a cutting board is great because a
64,for example he recently told me he built a jewelry box for a waitress at a, maybe some sort of eyepatch you can get it right on the canus,cutting board i get that from a woodworker and i say this is handy for
65,local diner and then made the waitress boyfriend a cutting board so he,but leave the funny dog nuts out,me and you didnt work very hard on it cause its just it is just wood
66,wouldnt get the wrong idea, especially when you get them on a bulldog oh thats funny, its a board dennis thank you so much i see that youve sort
67, aaaaye aye aye how do i tell my dad that this is weird, so maybe like a pair of glasses where the dog nuts go in the,of carved in very crudely griffins choppin zone and thats fun and i like
68, you gave him a list though griff you give him a list every year,nose part kinda like a twofor thing that covers the lipstick and the canus,it
69,in that sweet little stationary of yours thats just asking for things that, cover it up but with some kind of rip cord that the dog, its gonna be gross but i appreciate this took you three minutes
70,you get thats not the same thing,can implement if it needs to,to make and thats about how i value our friendship too because i do not
71, oh i like that, yes it is a one for one comparison the rock holding a gun and,know you except for when you come to this tgi fridays thank you so
72, i can sympathize with this because i love to bake a lot of times i,a dog exposing his anus,much the cheeseballs will be here very soon
73,find myself baking a whole tray of things nobody bakes you know three, whoa, yep thats true trav santa claus gets me stuff sometimes and
74,cookies, griffin you dont think he does hes the rock he is a very rich,i think is this dude in love with me or what
75,you gotta bake a pan of them and i dont know who to give them to so,and powerful person, he gets me a fancy watch and im like is this dude in love with
76,they end up maybe going to waste or eventually we take them to the, thats why they never did a reverse shot during wwe stuff,me because i dont know him from adam
77,other people at the hospital that sydnee works at or whatever on the, but arent we humans just animals, sometimes he gets me stuff not on the list and sometimes its
78,flipside of that i often find myself wishing that i had something it doesnt, ive always said that,like one time he got me under garments from meundies and im like
79,matter what it could be anything maybe i want some food i wish, i guess heres the thing question asker if it cleans the skin on,santa claus thats a little do you want to see me in these bud im not
80,someone would make me some food i think to myself but theres nowhere,your hands it probably does the rest of your body too right like its not,saying no but like i dont know you
81,to turn,like its perfectly suited just for your hand skin, i gotta say its exciting and i can see where the revenue stream
82,well hold on makes clicking noise i just clicked to the next slide im so, what about dish soap,is gonna come from
83,glad that you joined me here for this has this ever happened to you, because apparently one drop of dawn is enough to do a whole, i gotta say this i already invest in a app called free bees where
84, thank you talking shark,sink load of dishes so i feel like 3 drops of dawn would do a whole sink,they give away all the bees that they its where you can get bees on
85, so youve stopped talking which says to me your comedy,load of travis,sorta gratis so im out hums dramatic tune
86,partner justin mcelroy that you didnt listen to what i said closely enough, how to wash dishes no, that was good and i liked it
87,to build on it but you do want me to i drove over to your house with a, oh my goodness gracious justin you have two human children, laughing and a fourth one this instead which is good also
88,hot joke you said scoot over and then you drove me back to my house,that you take care of, how about a yahoo heres one from lawrence evelyn thank you
89,with that same now cooled stale laughs gelatinous joke, justins trained orangutan, i think ill puke if i have to see one mo
90, travis theres yes and nobut and travis had one this also,griffin laughing, i havent even gotten to the good stuff
91, i love the dog nuts cause thats hysterical whats he doing, oh yeah and so do the ladies, if i have to see one more canine anus winking back at me
92,with those, the ladies love cool archibald,dont get me started on doggy nuts or lipsticks its disgusting and im
93, thats great but the butthole are you kidding me with this thing, we were trying to save you because youre our brother and we,tired of being forced to see nude dogs everywhere should the
94,that close to the ground and with those few brain cells i dont think so,love you,government force dogs to dress in underwear
95,maybe sell crazy elsewhere cause were all full up here mister dog, with the god damn plug, also i think that the three words canine anus winking is maybe
96, i think lets cover it up unless it needs if it needs to it needs to, the same way human beings have kept water from running out,the worst sort of combination that ive ever sort of experienced in all my
97,thats what i know about dogs,of the thing forever,time with the english language i am tired of seeing these butts and
98, with his mouth he needs to be able to bite the cord that exposes, you have access to an amazon account,penises and its a double standard i do get it and approve of it and
99,his butt hole then he could become incredibly powerful and talented like, justins bleep if you can hear me order just in a sink drain,endorse it and will petition it i think
100,the rock when he holds a gun in the rundown when the dog needs an,plug from amazon now, justin where do you stand visàvis dog nuts
101,extra confidence boost he pulls the rip cord that exposes his anus and, get slippery, yeah id love to cover that lipstick up though if we could find a
102,then he knows that hes the real king of town at that point, if you go down the slipnslide covered in dish soap is that like,way to cover the lipstick but leave the the nuts are so objectively
103, youre not gonna give me this mortgage well hold on check,a shower,funny its like truck nuts but on my best friend whiskey the dog
104,this out makes ripping noise, so things are like showers and poetry so far if im keeping track, oh thats so good but we gotta cover that dick up though yuck
105, thats what the peoples eyebrow is connected to, get clean inside and out, thats real good im actually gonna put an embargo on the word
106, it tears his pants and exposes his butthole laughs, im a child because ill always laugh at the phrase get your cum,canus trav youre done with that one but thatd be fun make it look like a
107, travis has a great point they didnt do that one,out,marx brother down there
108, im sorry do a bunch of yahoo answers people suddenly count, wait what, now what if the rock also had some sort of rip cord that he
109,more than us podcasters i dont think so, maybe its excited like terms enthusiastically and conditions apply,could pull that makes his bung
110,i live with my two older brothers and their girlfriends someone keeps, very professional, interesting so every time he does the peoples eyebrow laugh
111,putting our hand soap in the shower despite there being an abundance of, get out of town wait whereat,his bung
112,communal body wash its a fancier bottle than what we usually buy so, wait griffin did you ever work at the huntington mall because, yeah you never see him from behind you only see his big
113,maybe theyre confused but ive even circled hand soap in black,if so that would be all four of us,powerful front its really interesting i never thought about it boys youre
114,marker, see i worked at the best buy justin i believe you are at both,never gonna believe this pretty much everybody on the comments section
115, you sound like a delight does this person know what theyre,the olive garden and the babbages,thinks this is bad thinks this is a bad idea and animals should be allowed
116,doing should i let this happen is there some way i could ask my, its the same guy,to be nude and that this is all human hang ups
117,roommates about their soap choices without learning more about them than, yeah i dont want like potato chips give me something gross, i mean a bungs a bungs a bung
118,i could ever want to know thats from my brother my brother my hand, i didnt even know that was the thing you could do i assume, clapping and laughing
119,soap and me in michigan,you mean bologna that youve microwaved not like a freezedried thing, i thought that hand soap in the shower was really just that whole
120, can we talk about something for a second, youre talking about like fried bologna,market was run by beach rental houses where you roll up in their sad
121, travis just said a drop of dawn would wash a sink full of dishes, you have just given me the strongest sense memory that one,shower and theres nothing inside of it except for like a little bit of hand
122,im sitting here and im telling you guys clears throat im realizing now i,time i remember spending the night at my friend chriss house when i was,soap and a squeeze bottle and youre like  i guess thisll get me clean
123,dont know how to wash dishes by the sink full,like 10 and he microwaved a slice of bologna and put pizza sauce and,thanks airbnb renters yeah thisll do i guess
124,i dont even know i couldnt soak dishes in the sink if i wanted to i dont,mozzarella on it and served it to me like bologna pizza, this is what 442 i think its 442 its been 441 episodes since we
125,know how to do that i have the little stick thats full of soap and a sponge, bridget to be fair with griffins stomach it would probably be,have talked about whether sudsy shower liquids are effectively
126,on the end that i wash the dishes with i dont know how to do that do you,better if he stopped eating solid food,interchangeable and i dont know if yall position have changed i think the
127,guys know how to do that, yeah now were talking,hand soap is gonna get you there but i also think hand soap to a big thing
128, like a sink if you wanted to wash a sink full of dishes right, thats where your personality shows through thats where its,of body wash you are paying more per ounce with the hand soap so like
129,where the sink is full of water and soap and theyre soaking in it and loving,like oh yeah doug doug only does cheese with mms in it that guy,from a monetary perspective i get it but its all sudsy bubble stuff you can
130,it do you know how to i would have to upturn i think id have to,when he does a cheese plate,use that shit anywhere
131,upturn a small plate to cover the drain of the sink is that what people are, and hes gonna make a joke about it and say like as gouda as, now were into it now were in here
132,doing,it gets or whatever thats doug, and with my porcelain china doll skin its gonna get me there
133, ive done the plate thing before is there another way that, like a gold cheese,i think man trav
134,people were doing it by the sink full, thats why people put that stinky blue on there right thats, how to wash dishes bud
135, hey guys dont get so distracted by this great new character,the challenge cheese we know youre not a finish that one, oh my god justin
136,that you forget to dunk on me, i went to a really bougie place recently in vegas where the, i mean justin also has archibald who does most of this stuff for him
137, i dont know what would i okay how,dude had a whole cheese cart and he asked us in questions like a, and the girls just love archibald
138, how are you filling up the how are you filling the sink,sommelier which i also think is bs he asked us some questions and, yeah the ladies love him
139, how are you filling the sink,then he said okay i think these are the three cheeses for you, he gets pretty strong and angry sometimes
140, dont have one, thats not real right he just had three cheeses in mind that he, yeah dude its bizarre i do dishes every week
141, i have not had a plug for a decade and am doing fine,was already going to give us because those were the cheeses he had, by getting th what
142, sure,thought of, what are you talking about by getting them wet and soapy and
143, laughs well its got glycerin in there, to be fair i wasnt i want to say the knowledge of wine isnt bunk,then scrubbing them with the sponge and then rinsing them off and putting
144, i didnt mess up is i bought some shampoo to replace my last,its the idea of saying this wine is better than this wine because of notes of,them in a dryer
145,shampoo plus conditioner obviously im not gonna do that twice i bought, hi im travis and the other food expert on this podcast sous vide, what the fuck are you talking about
146,some shampoo plus conditioner to replace my old shampoo plus conditioner,griffin got me into it, its not plutonium juice you dont have to handle it special
147,and then today when i was looking at my body wash i noticed on the label, you dont have to do anything and you throw that bag into some,you wash it like you would wash a car a child hey can i ask you guys a
148,it said laughs its also shampoo,water with the sous vide magic wand going and then you walk away and,question
149,i dont know how they put it i think they had like a more professional way,you can come back like three four 24 hours whatever hours later and its, a big bottle of bubble liquid that you would use to blow bubbles
150,of putting it but its like this is also shampoo in here i had to look at that,done,for a child to enjoy do you think you could get clean with that shit
151,new bottle and be kind of sad because its like im never ever going to, now griffin havent i balanced it out enough by literally using it, you want to get slippery maybe some people like that
152,use you im sorry i cant do this if i could have one all justin cleaning,every day for the last three weeks, i think thatll get you yeah most stuff is like a shower if you
153,liquid of course im going to do that, thank you,really think about it
154, gets your cum out, for christmas justin got me a knife block that is a magnetic, this is like the special goodburger sauce what if we mixed

199,i want to ask one though before we get started bridget what food are you,more someone id be afraid to disappoint i would say like a bradley,shakespeare in love and the best exotic marigold hotel his name is
200,most embarrassed about very much enjoying what kind of garbage do you,whitford,john madden that doesnt seem right
201,really get down on, oh wait wait wait steven weber final answer, that doesnt seem like it should be allowed
202, yeah but dont bridget i dont want you to pull out one that, steven weber final answer, its the huge football man i guess
203,makes you sound like a woman of the people you know i dont want a, i guess what were dealing with here is life uh finds a way, what in the world
204,populace choice here i want something nasty, we tried to take the land from the geese and now the geese, oh so some people like the cup because it captures all the
205, yeah no way i want like rough,are taking the land back,bologna sweat right there in it
206, what, eats god, shrieks
207, laughing dont eat that bologna you have microwaved it yet, mmmmm, i thought this would be like a fun food in segment where i would
208, now youre cooking you culinary expert you okay i have to ask, thats also aflacs second motto,learn about great foods and now i never want to eat ever again im gonna
209,a question thats the law i am obsessed with cheese platters whenever i, no,go by a lifetime supply of soylent and just kind of give the rest of it up
210,see one on a menu at a restaurant i try to order it unfortunately theyre, male gigolo, that would probably be good for me yeah
211,often very expensive and contain very small samples of cheese i have, you could just plan on leaving your house like 15 minutes late, the other two cheeses lock you know theyre going to be good
212,tried to recreate the magic at home but its just not the same how can i,and just be like the geese,the third cheese you can get something challenging
213,recreate a restaurant worthy where platter at home without breaking the, this jumbotron from scott, also if you dont want to leave the house you can usually just
214,bank thats from cheese obsessed in vermont, how quick,make one out of stuff youve got lying around you can do one with like
215, that explains everything, i guarantee heres what happened hey where do i find me,shredded cheese and then a big mound of cream cheese and some cheetos
216, i would probably do like my cheddar and blue would be cheap,for charcuterie, eating a hateful cheese that you know is going to be quite bad is
217,and bad and then my third powerful cheese i would get something,oh you should check out the deli,a really great way of becoming the monster here in 2019
218,incredibly powerful because no one can remember the other two anyway,oh im a deli meat kind of person, we talk about charcuterie a lot including later in this episode
219,because my third cheese is so important,either that or this person said where could i find me for a charcucutary,which we recorded this bit which is weird are you supposed to stack it all
220, nobody wants that one,and they were like mmm maybe you should stick with bologna ,up like a sandwich and go for it that way or are you supposed to enjoy
221, now bridget youre an expert you cannot tell people that, weve talked about charcuterie before on this show you,each thing one at a time
222,because then were going to have people going off smashing up,couldnt handle it, oh no
223,charcuterie with hammers and saying its okay bridget says its fine, you dont even know where to look where you gonna find the, travis own it you hate wine you hate wine people
224, he had three cheeses in his pocket,raw honeycomb you dont you cant get a lunchable start there, she is meeting you halfway that is such a generous response
225, im not, charcuterie junior new from hasbro, ive been wondering when we were going to get into this
226, i think bridgets going to agree with me here the big problem, thatll teach him, i love this i love this meat bath i was so excited i got one for
227,with the cheese plate is how all the cheese on it is raw ive been pretty, got you,justin a couple years ago i got one for travis justin why dont you chime
228,firm on my stance that raw cheese is inedible and it should always be, we also want to say we are going to be at podcon that is coming,in what have you been sous videing babe what have you got going on in
229,melted into a dip or pizza topping do you feel the same way as me,th,that meat bath bud
230,bridget,up january 19 and 20  so if youre in the seattle area and you want to, that i got you as a gift that i thought youd love like two
231, yeah im just gonna accept it i recently started living alone in,come you can grab tickets at podconcom there is also a remote,years ago
232,my cooking skills arent that great i also dont have a lot of time that to,attendance option where a little bit after the event you can basically get, yeah youre a good one

234,multiple meals out of during the week,podcon too so even if you cant make it you can still hear all the stuff thats,does that in the kitchen he like throws the knife and it gets caught on the 
235, laughs i ,discussed there go to podconcom also go check out mcelroyfamily,and thats appropriate because whenever i get my knife sharpened at the
236, griffin really did get me a sous vide thing that really is still in the,there is a lot of cool stuff on there but also theres a link to our live shows,farmers market i bring it home im very much in this persons shoes where

238,waiting for a real special time for me and my family,th,sentimental value i cannot risk dulling this beautiful blade
239, lets see for my birthday my friend bought me a very fancy,th, i would worry that i would be like well ive already got the glove
240,chefs knife something ive wanted for quite some time but as i started,new orleans louisiana shows thats coming up february 8 10  and 11,lets just go ahead and buy a full chain mail suit of armor
241,cooking a meal for myself and my partner i couldnt bring myself to remove,if i remember correctly so go check that out mcelroyfamily as well as, ive been watching a lot of marie kondo and i dont think shed be
242,this beautiful blade from its cardboard packaging,everything else we do,so down on me owning a whole set of chain mail armor i think it would
243,it looks so pristine and perfect it seems a shame to use it for something as, sure do,spark me a little bit of joy right now but then very quickly it would just be a
244,mundane as topping tomatoes i use my old nasty knives to prepare the, im travis mcelroy,lot of armor
245,meal instead but now im afraid of never using this wonderful blade ive, im your middlest brother travis mcelroy, that might be a good point yeah and you know when the shit
246,been gifted help how do i break in my new knife in an appropriate way or,audience cheering,hits the fan ill be the one wearing chain mail and she wont be

253,arbys so my friend had one that he would use for cooking all the time, welcome to your number one frankenstein fancast, do you want me to talk to the little cylinder guy youve got in
254,because there is little more empowering than cooking with the chain mail, i mean wouldnt it be great maybe thats something we could,the kitchen and make it get you a new shirt because i can do that
255,glove its like i dont care ill do whatever i want i cut how i want where,offer at podcon3, and say catty things about the clothes youre wearing and
256,i want,where like youre all sitting there watching but also your wearing,murder you and yeah for sure
257, youre an allinone cooking robot,headphones and just getting the audio feed through there and youre all, now lets talk about those jeans what in the world
258, bridget lancaster thank you so much for joining us on my,in individual cubicles and dont have to see each other, maybe it can just be carson kressley up there like his eye the
259,brother my brother and me where can people find your work your body, thats the dream,queer eye the queer eye floating in the air telling you these things that
260,of work if you will,audience laughter,could be good so i took some stool softeners about an hour ago for
261, it is our pleasure thank you so much for being here bridget, youre looking for funding,personal reasons and if i dont get up and address the effects of those right
262,lets get back to the rest of the program, huh,now im gonna blastoff like team rocket im so sorry guys
263, i could see what theyre kind of saying because if you think about, this is my canvas, are you guys still going
264,it in an irobot sense youve basically just created ears that lay on your,audience laughter, but if you guys kept doing stuff without me here i am going
265,counter like an ear and a mouth that lay on your counter but they, this brings me joy,to have to leave in the part where i took stool softeners and had to get
266,desperately want to get up and look at you and follow you around the house, but more than that ive also seen poor cosplay planning where,out
267,and kill you and help you make breakfast and take your kids to school,i did once see spiderman walk up to a urinal and go aww, yeah okay so are you talking about robot butler or are we
268, go sugarman, and then i just had to picture a fully naked spiderman right there,still talking about the eye because if its a robot butler
269, so well just keep doing this show i guess hey travis i know, no but this is wonderful because normally when you do this at, well its not trav
270,something we can talk about while griffins gone i dont want to waste his,home people cant see that its not that you dont have the questions, it would change for me if its a robot butler with a robot bod it
271,time with you you said sugarman but really though if you had an,pulled up you just dont know what youre saying,would probably be rosie odonnell just because it would make me laugh all
272,android at your house what celebrity would you most want its personality, where is this store,the time and if it was just an eye floating above me though i would want
273,to embody, are you prepared for the reality that you get there and like,something more ominous like a tilda swinton if there was a tilda swinton
274, okay,he invites you in and its just him eating eight bags of chips by,telling me that i dont need more syrup i have four bottles of syrup stop
275, do you have an answer for me or where are you at on this,himself,buying syrup every time i go to the store or also that my jeans are whack i
276, dulé hill,audience laughing,want that to be a stern stern tilda
277, i think mine would probably be john larroquette because i feel, oh thank god please come in im so hungry, oh yeah
278,like ,  ive been waiting for someone to ask ive been buying the, yeah get a shiv up there
279, yeah we were just talking about if we had a robot butler,best pizzas, travis goes hard for steve stans for steven
280,what celebrity personality,  ive been getting all the name brand sodas come on, we should be clear we are talking about if you could copy and
281, yeah exactly it was a good time, do you think he would take a bite and be like  more like,paste the personality of that person so they would be around you all
282, its all the same hey griffin if you had a celebrity i just said,cracklemore laughs no please dont leave,the time youre not talking about literally sort of uploading steven
283,john larroquette because i feel like kind of catty definitely loves loyalty,audience laughing,webers actual consciousness black mirror style
284,but can be a little bit catty with people but also hard worker smartest guy, after youth group, laughs its not bad i mean man creates goose goose
285,in the room would love that as my robot butler, because youre not gonna know anybody there,delays man god kills man goose kills god
286, its an android that lives in your house what celebrity, except macklemore, goose eats god women rule the world
287,personality would you want it to be,  theyre cool, food for thought hey is it possible the insurance company
288, see now i would say toby ziegler would be the one that i,  they always give me the best chips,youre working for is aflac and these geese are here by design
289,would most not want to disappoint like no way,  so lets take a moment to thank this grocery delivery person,because the aflac duck heeds to fuck so they bring in
290, get shiv in the mix all right,for the great chips, the aflac motto is 15 or more off 50  or whatever no thats
291, steven weber is good, if only there was an easier way to have pizzas delivered,geico but they have a motto the other one is the aflac duck gots to fuck
292, putting him in a jar like brocktoon laughs heres another, so we are not talking about the the slides dont contain, a duck in a goose a goose is just a pretty duck i dont know
293,question i work for an insurance company or corporate campuses several,sexsual material,why
294,buildings serviced by an access road that feeds out to the main strip the, this is more like the deliverythe tone of voice the pacing, or a deuce thats not good either
295,grounds are nicely landscaped including a big pond near the entrance, you know i think that when you see someone do something, deuce guck rob is back and this time hes playing 12 duck half
296,problem is this has attracted a big flock of geese that wander the grounds,theyre very good at that can be an intense like if you see someone,goose monstrous hybrid who is here for your sexual needs hes deuce guck
297,sometimes theyll just walk out on the access road and cause traffic jams, i was i pulled the ripcord and i bailed out of it three quarters of,guck gigolo
298,the most heinous thing i saw where a gaggle of geese standing from the,the way through, its so good
299,access road where it meets the main road and seven cars backed up waiting,  please dont look at my parachute, now justin youre suggesting that these people who are going
300,for them to move you couldnt even go around them because of the,audience laughter,to send them upstate are somehow able to collect all geese
301,median ive yet to be trapped by them but i know its only a matter of time, and thats all ive got bye thats my time, i feel like dilbert got weird when it was then more about them
302,before they make me late for work what can i do to get rid of these geese, thank you i guess what im saying is you know when you,killing geese but i think following scotts arc his journey through this life
303,without hurting them thats from my goose is cooked in massachusetts,watch hank and john make a podcast and youre like damn,and the sort of unorthodox path that hes decided to carve through it i
304, ill allow it go on, what i love is when,think it makes a lot of sense
305, and as we all know ducks love to fuck geese, ah and they just cum, oh scott youve done it again
306, laughs the aflac duck a cross species breeder that is an abject, oh okay sorry sorry sorry can we take it back edit that out, hey do you guys want a quick yahoo
307,horror to god himself, laughs, this one was sent in by level 9000 yadrew druid drew davenport
308, griffin it would make a guck and im not a fan of this portmanteau, i guess im kind of the bad boy of the podcast, thats what it was these baguettehavers they heard you say
309, a deuce guck,audience laughter,yeah im looking for some good meats for some charcurgtory and they
310, laughing you monster, begged,were like oh babe oh sweetheart you are not prepared for youre
311, i just think that if that happens lets not get rid of the geese, what did you net,gonna get hurt youre gonna hurt yourself
312,alright lets leave the geese and then be late for work whenever the fuck, that is not divisible by three, you couldnt handle it they call it sharp cheddar for a reason
313,you want to,audience laughter, a lunchable is like a thats right its like a training charcuterie
314, the geese again and then eventually theyll round up all, im sorry to math you like that 21 perhaps or 18, charcuterie
315,the geese and theyll send them to a sarcastically real nice geese, thats moms cut, and you could do it like those bad chevy commercials where you
316,farm upstate real nice fellow employees, i also think it would be worth it just gifting the story to the,get a bunch of people sitting at a table and maybe theyre professional
317, im saying that if it starts cutting into employee productivity,goodwill employee who opened the bag and was like,chefs some of the best chefs in the country im talking about real emeril
318,corporate america will find a way to evict these geese to hell thats kind of, theres like 30 pairs of khaki shorts in here is this person,lagasse types and theyre sitting there at the table and you say here
319,what i think is that theyll probably kill all the geese so there is a limited,doug funnie what the hell,have some charcuterie while you wait and they eat it and then emeril is
320,number of times you could use this excuse would be my concern,audience laughter,like hey this is pretty good charcuterie and then you pull it off and its
321, oh scott, it sounds like you have the power,been lunchables and hell never work in this town again
322, you made us talk about you scott you win this round, you have something they want and you, thatll teach him for fucking kicking it up so much listen theres
323, i dont believe this i dont believe that any one has ever,say do your homework and i shall floss,a reason the rest of us arent kicking it up all the time emeril and now its
324,told anybody you look like a deli ham person,yes teacher,time for you to pay the piper youve been embarrassed by my lunchables
325, it is they should start calling at that id bet youd rope in, so wait hold on audience dont reward this in your mind this,commercial
326,some dumb people charcuterie junior,teacher of this wonderful podcon guest just stood up one day and said, i think that pretty much covers it right thanks to john rodrick

346,garage punk song, yeah excellent point jasom i am saddened by jasoms question, its nearly the end of day one i have just ive had a great
347, the world is not responsible for fixing your life look at the person,because of the line there will not be a time when i will be on the moon,time my mind is flooded with great new podcast ideas
348,in the mirror the person oh thank you,andor able to smell the moon which does create a scenario where, that would be
349,audience laughter,jasom is on the moon but is unable to smell it because of that pesky, i had an idea for a podcast i wanted to bounce off you guys
350, thank you so much hi welcome to my brother my brother and,glass in the helmet and hes just picking up handfuls of moon dirt going,because im looking for collaborators im shopping around currently
351,me an advice show for the modern era im your oldest brother justin,huffing sound no as hes sucked back into space, im looking for 15 million in startup funding i had this idea for
352,mcelroy, it would fall at the same speed as a feather yes,a podcast that was inspired from my experience of being here and the
353,audience cheering,audience laughing,podcast i dont have a title or anything yet its still very early days but
354, so welcome to my brother my brother and me this is kind of a, whoaaaaaa,its about how to use a convention center bathroom like an adult
355,notable episode in terms of live shows weve ever done in our entire lives, whoa were sober but are we stoned,audience laughter
356,because we are sober, but no heres the problem: there would be no context because, thats not a judgment of the podcon attendees i would say you
357,audience laughter and cheering,it literally smells like nothing on earth so you would smell the moon and,all are above average in that department
358, fair enough,youd be like,ive been to a lot of cons in my day and theres just something about
359,audience laughter,it smells like something what would you compare it to,stepping foot into a convention center that makes a lot of people
360, theres definitely a sense of i love meeting everybody but i bet, but think of the loneliness that you would have as being the only,apparently feel like  this is not my home i can do whatever i want in
361,at least a few people in this room had this thought  this has been so fun i,one whos ever smelled the moon you could never discuss it with anyone,here
362,would actually at this point like to go home and just listen to some podcasts, weve talked about this too seriously for too long,its universal not just marie kondo could be doing like a manners
363,please i need a little bit of a break, what do you think a moon tastes like,convention and step into a convention center bathroom stall and be
364, probably comicon is the best for this because i love seeing, like cheese,like  lets see what i can do in here
365,beloved characters come out of the shitter there is nothing better than like, it smells like neil armstrongs feet, seeing a spiderman walk out of the bathroom stall and youre like
366,i just saw deadpool and he was pooping, ps im jennifer garner,oh sick costume and you walk in after them and youre like  great
367, oh no,audience cheering,responsibility dog like  youve done irresponsible things in here spidey
368,audience laughter, no matter how interesting or like unusual the thing youre doing, what else does this store sell
369, at that point the mask becomes essential no one can know,is theyre like gotta take picture of this stranger is always weird, okay dont brag about it
370,so anyway we hope youre enjoying podcast convention 2 we know,even if you were flying and someone was like well theyre not looking, holy shit thats like half of you are you here by the way
371,we are so lets get into the podcast proper,like thats weird its uncomfortable,question asker

373,like into wisdom,is like me and is just sitting there like this human being can focus on a, to the tune of thrift shop by macklemore
374,later in the program we are going to be taking some questions from,project that long who is this,im gonna pop some bags makes a hissing
375,the audience so please start cooking those up in your noggin, what were they going to do with that fucking,sound
376,were going to do some other stuff first though so lets get right into,picture instagram youll never believe it a scarf,audience laughter
377,that sounded sinister, or like a net you can throw over them , laughing
378, so here we go, give me the camera and then you smash it on the ground, laughing
379,audience laughter,and then you knit them a new camera, laughing i dont think theres a person alive who is talking to
380,  i work for a grocery delivery service downtown and one of,audience laughter,somebody and they are like  how did you meet your best friend or
381,our regular customers is macklemore, thats just called the hammock,significant other and theyre like i met them at macklemores party that

387,some baller parties i frequently shop this order for him and it always,i right put your phones down and look at the dude with two heads, the framing of it itself can be
388,makes me hungry how do i get him to invite me to these parties please, one head was in a bag, were you about to say the words intensely sexual out loud
389,sir may i have some macklemore in seattle, whats the answer, you stuffed the ripcord back in the hole like no no no get back
390, question is macklemore a seattle person, still someone should have noticed or cared good for you doug,in there
391,audience shouting  yes,eating healthy, that was a challenging thought to float at a convention about
392, round of applause how common is this have yall, thats my favorite thing because every so often youll see one,a specific craft trav
393,seen macklemore around,where its like 10 likes 100 dislikes and im like i gotta check this, yeah

398,gotta be on the edge of chip fashion, laughs,wont be blue like my rude brother travis
399, i need you to think through whether or not you really want, hey rea im going on a date tonight how do i look, the official clothes of summer camp
400,macklemore to invite you to his party if macklemore i know you think, get it, no

405, macklemore is going to be like look this is my grocery person, good for her were all trying to get there right, i think if you want to stop the flow you need to find some way

457,courtney in vancouver,theres a casino on the cruise ship just  i think fearbased is the way, that would be bad
458, is this how far gone we are that they have not seen people,youre gonna want to go, are you here
459,floss before theyve never learned how is that fascinating, maybe is there a patsy in your office that you can be like listen i,stitching in your snapchat stories whooping
460, thats why thought it was so funny,cant take all the cruise fun you know sharon was saying the other day how, the great news is you already have two sharp objects in

464, i did think it was weird that they flossed in from of the students, maybe you could go one more time but really tanks this one,audience laughter
465,but also ive been alive for 38 years and floss has meant one thing for, like you eat all the shrimp and you forgot your sandals so you, that would actually be very comfortable thatd be a
466,like 37 of those so fuck off,have to wear business shoes to the pool,bad punishment knit me up a cocoon
467,audience laughter and cheering, but in a good way, a fully enclosing apparatus 
468, i know what iti know what it means, now griffin are you saying that they are going to have a bad, yeah i would say so

470,audience cheering,stop coming to the dude cruise movies so that they can stop making them, hey this is unconventional but i have a riddle laughs
471, not in a million years, for dude cruise 3: cruise to the moon,audience cheering
472, youre making the show worse because theres not a reality, how many more crabs can he put on there, we do a segment called riddle me piss
473,in which this will happen its an audio product and im not gonna, so the concern is that in smelling it it was ripping that cotton, in the voice  riddle me piss and travis loves to take it over
474,have, well maybe its still holding it,and do the voice and i hate the voice i like to keep it very straitlaced
475, goodbye, you said i couldnt rip,here on riddle me piss
476,audience laughter, do they make special vape juice for cats, this is a riddle does it say travis you know this website does
477, jesus told me that floss has meant something for 2000 years and, or like catnip imagine that like i breathe out just a mad cloud,it say who did it no someone did this riddle and they thought it was cool
478,it wouldnt have occurred to him either he says,and my cat is just like i love this and there is my cat just swirling around,enough to share with the internet now im going to read it here in this
479,audience laughter,in it having a good old time now im dead because i inhaled catnip but,room work it over in your own brain  i dont know why my voice just
480, its the lack of atmosphere on the moon that would make it so,thats okay,sounded like that
481,you cant smell anything up there right even if you could , i think its just that its forbidden,audience laughter
482, youre saying that if its the dark part of the moon you can , because its still a schedule 1 drug so when cats get the chance, do not shout the answer out ill be furious
483,like the rock still has a look even though you cant see it,to get catnip they just go fucking crazy because theyre like  who knows, a man with two heads walked down the street but no one noticed
484, heres what im saying okay im pretty sure about this you,when ill get more catnip i dont have a car or a job,or cared why a man with two heads walked down the street but no one
485,could never smell anything on the moon without compromising it without, so youre talking about whats the flavor or whats the brand,noticed or cared why
486,our terrible earth smells,name, you just wanted to say zaphod beeblebrox out loud
487, if you brought a moon rock back in a vacuum from space i, maybe a saucer of milk, yeah thats okay
488,think you could have one chance where you could like get the good, you know what i like cream kitty like cream, the second head was the head of lettuce he was carrying
489,smell of it without the dirty earth air, kitty like cream, this is from riddlescom a website we like to visit from time to
490, now this is 2019 they would bring back millions of rocks in tiny,  oh is this that cream ill lap it up makes licking noises,time and i did not realize about this website there is a likedislike function
491,vacuum boxes and they would all be wrapped in blind boxes so youd have, lap it up would be a good name for a brand yeah,sort of similar to youtube videos i look through a few of these i
492,to have unwrapping videos and the people would smell them on youtube, mmhm the problem is you can only do that once,looked through a lot of these theres not a single one with a positive
493,is how it would probably go down they wouldnt just bring back one, laughing,ratio
494,moon rock in a vacuum box, is there a way to have a flavor that when the cat tastes it it,audience laughter
495, im just saying its kind of a bummer that you cant smell the moon,tastes like dave killed a mouse when i taste it it tastes like the peace of, yeah i gotta know
496, no im not gonna do that its just rocks but like the smell of the,mind i have knowing that my kitty kills the mice, we didnt time our segments out very well
497, no like the smell of the moon, listen what i make is art and its up to your interpretation im, oh the evil number almost

604,physical structure, and thats gonna do it for us this week so,turbo batteries and what have you tanks and all of it im thinking
605, there are marks involved but you wont feel like a mark when, yeah but you know what,specifically of the juices and the flavors were designed so that humans

2422, im gonna call it were gonna call it the art of goku, beak, thats good hey i didnt know i didnt know robert frost was
2423, and i think that is that is gonna get the message across that this, weve already got beaked yeah,still alive
2424,is a place to be reckoned with if you want to put some beef on your bones, yeah i like that, laughs okay
2425, thats a direct reference okay, corporeal, nothing delicious can stay eating noises
2426, goku maker one he gets his power from the yellow sun so thats, opaque, what
2427,no good, birds are opaque, whats the points for though
2428, a real goku maker is the yellow sun secondly thats a direct, ooh okay, yes
2429,reference to the popular character goku from dragon ball zed, i feel like thats describing birds in one word, yes pizzies or pizzers
2430, okay, yes, so okay
2431, i like this so far, toronto works, it seems not great if you well dominos has really turned their
2432, okay i like that, now heres my question maybe the last three words griffin,shit around is what they want you to believe but its still dominos is
2433, laughs,because it didnt say we cant use punctuation can just be you know,okay but you go around taking pictures of pizza like youre in fucking
2434, laughs,birds and its just you know comma birds question mark,pokémon snap and then you go to the dominos and show em your camera
2435, when you say it out loud vegeta sounds like a grandmother, hungry,roll and you just kinda swipe through it and they say yup yup yup
2436,trying to order mexican food, hungry,circle with little circles on it yup yup yup heres a pizza and then you
2437, give me vege ey give me one of them vegetas, yes,can take a picture of that and then it never ends

2439,making muscles anyone can do that, vain yeah yeah yeah, laughs
2440, what i think youre doing really at a gym is investing in yourself, so wait youre saying you would look at a bird and say i would, that robots gonna see some stuff though
2441,its about investment,let that bird maybe like hang out with my daughter who would be its, laughs i am i am pizza electronics sputtering out sound
2442, so heres what i think you should do is call it gokus bank and,niece,the sweet relief you would feel after exploding after seeing
2443,that, laughs okay yeah laughs, tens of thousands of pictures of dudes just like spreadout
2444, that could be a little more palatable i think, did we say delicate,assholes that they send to dominos
2445, not much, yeah, its it all ends up the same all the simulations end the same
2446, right, yeah,way i dont i dont get
2447, laughs, zany i thought you said veiny, i sent a picture of the ro my asshole to the robot so i hope

2457, laughs, beak,boatmen

2559, its a sweet snack okay if you i heres a problem though i, especially once you introduce that the food you ate was biscuits,good for shoveling only you dont use blower on yard snow
2560,like my dessert later in the evening,and gravy if you ate some like you grabbed an individual like container, thats thats wild god gave us shovels just for yard snow
2561, i dont like to have my dessert directly after dinner i like to let it,of lucky charms or you grabbed like,now sidewalk snow you can shoot that with a big gun if you want to
2562,settle a little bit okay, a frozen danish that had been thawed out thats fine, these gotta be potent powerful snowblowers

2669, mmhmm, i would like to tell you about meundies now weve talked about, i would say throughout the fullness of time in your life
2670, this is actually kind of weird cause like why doesnt everybody do,meundies before i can tell you about their like underpants and shirts which, youve probably eaten a lot of grapes not you know maybe
2671,this all the time this seems like such a good crime that im surprised its,are like three times softer than cotton there are different prints you can,not the average maybe not more than the average maybe less than that
2672,not extremely extremely common i mean maybe it is extremely common,get solid colors adventurous prints you can match with your partner, right down the fucking middle and whats the proce go ahead
2673,but it just seems like a grift everybody is probably running all the time,whatever i want to talk about the sleep pants which is uh i think maybe,paint me a little word picture of you sitting in the living room you decide
2674,right,the greatest invention ever given to humankind,you want some grapes and then just sort of walk me through the whole
2675, laughs, they are the comfiest things ive ever worn ever and i would like,process up to you chewing and swallowing the grapes so go ahead give
2676, laughs,to be buried in them and you can get your 15 off your first pair of,me the process
2677, laughs,meundies free shipping and 100 satisfaction guarantee if you go to, and hey dont play with funnytimes because its me playing at
2678, it says here his job title was keyboard lord do you guys really,meundiescommybrother thats meundiescommybrother,you you get to be mr serious fucking ben stein over there with mocking

2683, laughing if sounds mr gates if i could be so bold it sounds, i would say just off the top of my head if you want to make it, okay im glad that youve filled that out for me trav and then
2684,like really steven was kind of the brains behind the entire operation to,like a real ultimate jim carrey tribute party youre going to need to,justin so youve done this quite a few times yes you would say
2685,me,reference copper mountain the film he did in 1983 that was a made for tv, and you tell me now how many outlier times you have done it
2686, what are you uh what are you gonna do without him sounds,movie costarring alan thicke that was basically an hourlong um,where you then take the grapes and you put them in the microwave before
2687,like he was pretty valuable for the organiza,commercial for a club med location,eating them
2688, gallaghers brothers started performing and doing the sledgeomatic routine and a lot of gallaghers jokes cause gallagher couldnt meet, its a great listen a great film you could also maybe do all in, please now tell me yes
2689,the demand of people that wanted to see gallagher perform so his brother,good taste another 19, how many times a number exact estimation whatever you can
2690,started performing and then um when he got in trouble with his brother, okay,get it to please thank you
2691,for somethin he started performing as gallagher too and the reason im, yeah, and so i guess my followup question to that would be why
2692,bringing this up is that theres probably room for a gallagher three, maybe just pieces of rubber, no you have made it about grapes
2693, if you wanted to like no one would know i think the, thats very good earth girls are cheesy, okay
2694,situations confusing enough that you could probably claim to have been, earth girls are easy, okay
2695,gallagher too at a certain point or you know, oh its just cheese but you get cookie cutters and its like, well i like diet pepsi but i drink other stuff too so i guess if
2696, thank you,yknow like shaped like a woman,youre just not this is the worst weve ever done on a question because

3081,this is the most insane thing thats ever been in a press release and i, well nothing was funny about a flute solo, yeah and those havent even been around since like 1999 so
3082,just, the problem is is we started talking 20 minutes before you started, please
3083, i just i read a lot of press releases and the turn this press,playing it there was no clear delineation of where this episode started, thats hersheys if memory serves
3084,release takes its its really its really challenging and i am so sorry, in our hearts, yes but anyway i used the waterpik today and my congressional
3085,about putting this press release into yalls heads because i was actually, laughs you got me you got me,medal of honor has yet to appear and im confused about that
3086, uh, also hey um it was very nice of your coworker to give you a free, or at least a big boy sticker
3087, it slaps so hard youll be stanning,tank or whatever i guess but its hard for me to condone any pet owner, blasting it
3088, sorry no bud stanning,thats like oh you want okay great, uh have you ever used one of those massage chairs at the airport
3089, stanning for days thats how thats proper usage of,thats like if i said oh you need like a new crate for your dog cool,that have like the balls in it that go in
3090,that right just you stan for certain amounts of time and then cease, heres my crate with my dog in it byeee, imagine just putting your teeth right into one of those somehow
3091,stanning after you enjoy something deeply, hold on thats true of me too if im in front of a mirror,like sort of sitting on it teethfirst and just sort of get over the hygiene
3092, what, i yeah,issues associated with that but yknow physically thats sort of the feel
3093, its the same guys its the same guys its the same paragraph, if you get a bigger tank the fish isnt like ah more room for,that were talking about um and
3094, laughs film me with my lover anyway choochoo choochoo betch it says betch you tell me how to say it you tell me,furniture laughs, and then the water theres a sort of uh yknow manners issue of
3095,how thats is said, the only reason to get a bigger tank is to put more fish in it right,what you do with the water as its being blasted in you dont want anybody
3096, you say it betch,you cant do that,to see the unsightly sight of you yknow getting on in there and just
3097, betch, when we were growing up we had a fish tank and our dad put,dribbling water out of your mouth like some sort of sea monster so do you
3098, choochoo betch the love train is leaving the station and you,that like a sticky,swallow it all the answer is yes and its bad
3099,better get on board, well well get to that in a second but he put this like thing on, sure like a human water feature situation
3100, get on board or um actually could i vote for the sweet release of,the back that was just like just a picture of like undersea kelp or whatever, yeah but folks
3101,being crushed under its wheels,i guess that you like stuck to the back of the tank as if the fish was like, but i have so much air moving between my theyrethe gaps
3102, is that an o is that an option,oh now im back in the ocean,between my teeth are so big and id never appreciated it
3103, oh by the way all the ways the video for all the ways is a song, but also we kept the fish tank in the back room of our house, yeah theres a littlei
3104,that uh she sings asking a guy to tell her all the ways in which he loves her,which was i guess poorly insulated and not heated and one very cold, thats all the words he knows cause its the only words in the
3105,it is not about all the different ways that the lady from all about that bass,winter it froze solid so dad took it to his office to thaw so he could get new,song i used my waterpik today
3106,and the ginger from spy kids are doinking its not about that as far as i,fish and when it thawed dad claims all the fish were fine, we can make jokes but i used my waterpik today
3107,can tell the video probably peatures features a mansized teddy bear, and then he said they started to run and play just like they were, whats up
3108, i dont know what to say about this,young again, my favorite part is that the sort of relationship ive built and how
3109, laughs, laughs uhhuh,its evolved with my dentist who at my first cleaning was like  oh my
3110, groans, and maybe you know lets see a candlestick,god because it had been a while since my last confession and then every
3111, yeah i didnt see that coming, a revolver,sort of yknow six months or so he would be like  wow you really need to
3112, right, yeah might i recommend maybe you put them in that smaller,floss
3113, uhhuh,tank and then you move that across the room still in the line of sight of,and then hed be like  uh you should really be flossing or at the very least
3114, laughs i run on podcast energy,the betta but far enough away that the betta wont try to attack and then,go get a waterpik and then like on my last appointment he was like  i
3115, laughing its some good crickets,every day you move that tank one inch closer,know youre not going to floss i give up go buy a waterpik and then i
3116, i dont know why the clip has to be so long okay its finally over, and then maybe in like six years you dump em in,used it two weeks later
3117,sorry laughs its like its a cricket sound effect thats so long that after, you could also um following up on griffins thing scoop those, ill be honest yeah a little bit and im trying
3118,it gets the desired effect it actually needs another cricket sound to come in,other fish into the smaller bowl and then take it back to work and hand it, yeah so im trying to figure out if theres other holes i can get the
3119,after it cause it went on so long that no ones laughing anymore so its,to your coworker and say hey heres your fucking family members you,food in if theres other sort of stuff i can do
3120,like a recursive a recursive cricket sound effect,gave me, theres gotta be other places i can get the food in and i know the

3314,didnt know that going in but i feel good about it, i like this chicken i just wanted it to taste more like chicken, i didnt blow right past snacks we spent a long time in snacks but
3315,  wanting to save a few dollars i stopped at the hotel and walked, laughs,we have lots of things to figure oh

3317,and helped myself to biscuits and gravy, just inches away from his bed, i need to take a minute away from the bit and just close my eyes
3318,  i dont know if it was paranoia or if it was legitimate but as i was, thats where his dog stays,and visualize that good grinch heat hes gonna bring to this honored role of

3845,so reality tv couple sean and catherine lowe you know i do i wonder if, she showed up and everybodys like oh shes back and shes like,corn lives that you can see it through the glass does have to be refrigerated

3857,couple whose love story is as unique as the new bread, there were drones there,does that help but i dont know that theres any way it possibly could
3858, it wasnt fake before but weirdly it is fake now now our love is, i think that ii think that rather than tell someone like if if someones,help we would have to splinter our reality into another dimension which i
3859,fake,like hey sally whyd you leave the party dont say there werent enough,dont

3908,clarify a little bit if you had not had we have the bags backstage and it, oh that ones in there, the absolute mad
3909,looks like the balance of powdered sugar to beignets is i wish i could go, start new shows like, the absolute mad lad the fucking mad lad
3910,panning for beignets thats really what were talking about, we started with just my brother my brother and me and look how many, yeah thats a funny woodwind right there

3916, thats true griffin but ive been here for two days i think theres,then like you completely forget about it and then youre gonna miss your,about confronting this person because this is a wild twist and turn that
3917,a lot of things you could walk around the streets of new orleans doing and,window to get all of these awesome rewards and to be part of the drive and all,theyve sent you spiraling down
3918,its not gonna bat an eye also i have seen more people that look like,that stuff, yeah
3919,theyre doing coke and no people that look like theyre police officers ive, oh one more thing before i forget we have a youtube channel, laughs
3920,seen almost none none none of them, mcelroy family on youtube and weve been doing a bunch of like, awesome
3921, were not sending anybody to jail we might as well store,livestreams and extra stuff on there maybe by the time this comes out ill have, i still think this story is apocrypha
3922,butterflies are you okay,posted uh theresa did like a retro hair tutorial on there go check it out and, oh kelp sick
3923, youre on trial for being too delicate and beautiful,we will probably do some more livestreams on there so mcelroy family on, lies lies lies from our dad
3924, you could probably ask around if theres a lot of people eating,youtube, yeah sure uh i have two solutions for this that i think are both
3925,beignets i guarantee theres a few people thats like ugh, gasps my wife,equally amazing and one is to um arm the other fish
3926, i ate one im good for a good long while, borat voice my wife, arm the other fish with knife and pipe and gun small ones
3927, god i dont know how you all do it theyre really good, laughs,obviously
3928, theyre really good, im travis mcelroy, uh yes
3929, i mentioned the bag of powdered sugar i did root around there like, im your middlest brother travis mcelroy, a poison if you want too and then the betta will not have a
3930,some sort of specially trained pig just to find the beignets, oh oh,weapon but is a weapon so there will be a little bit more equal grounds
3931, that new orleans magic, were trying to lead into the hey griff what ya sketchin about,there i feel like and maybe itll be like a mutuallyassured destruction thing
3932, about the great snl skit we saw about new orleans the day before, pga,and theyll leave each other alone
3933,we came here and then it was like well thats unavoidable, oh no,um and the other solution is you still have the other original tank the
3934, it was very good sorry the spirit of jade haunted porcelain doll, are they doing like and 1 street golf,original small tank so you scoop up the other fish and you do a little you
3935,very active let me try to break up the pacing of that that makes sense, wait wants wants what back,know prince and pauper swapperoo and you know these fish that were
3936,theres no punctuation to help but the spirit of jade haunted porcelain, oh,swimming in this bigass tank living the high life now have to trade places

4136, well i was just trying to find the music and you guys were like i, guaranteed wheres the scene of all the little fish that follow triton,any complaints about the meat or the bevy of the nearly two dozen sauces

4141, bassoons are weird i didnt even know bassoons could do that, yes i know you work for me you all work for me dammit,weird
4142,last week my coworker and i were discussing pets and i mentioned that i, mattresses, the like box that usually has their name in it loads but it doesnt
4143,was hoping to upgrade my betta fish to a bigger tank once i had saved, whats that about bees,have their name in it it has nothing in it it says 15 percent best answers
4144,enough money to do so pointless she then told me not to get a tank, what what is,so thats actually maybe one of the highest ive seen they have 52365
4145,since she had once she could give to me obviously i happily accepted this,low quality seinfeld bass riff,yahoo points which has earned them the level of seven and theyve done
4146,since it would be free as opposed to the alternative laughs thank you, mattresses thats okay,11934 answers this person is the chosen one but i cant see their name
4147, today she showed up at my house with the tank all its, whoa, it might be neo so neo asks if you could create a potion what
4148,accessories and the fish that were apparently still using it as a residence, but thats it,type of potion would it be
4149,oh no, and you know heres the thing, basically what would you name it and what effect would it have
4150, i was never told about these fish and i cant just add my betta, even if youre someone who doesnt have sex i highly recommend these, yeah
4151,with them as bettas are extremely territorial and kill most other fish do i,beds for the sleeping part, huh
4152,ask her to take the fish back if she doesnt have a tank to keep them in or, or youre gonna love not having sex on em either way, i wish there was a potion i could drink when i walk onto an
4153,am i stuck with the responsibility of owning fish i never wanted in the first, laughs youre either eating mating or sleeping on a casper mattress,airplane that would guarantee that i wouldnt have to use the bathroom at
4154,place thats from aquatically challenged in albertville this is a terrible, theyre great to eat on,all until the plane ends
4155,situation you find yourself in and im very sorry, laughs, actually no sorry cause then the genies gonna catch me in a
4156, i the reason i said pointless i interjected that is cause i already, well,trick if i say it like that because the planes gonna land and then im
4157,knew that bettas are very territorial you have to have a betta by itself, it just says 700000,gonna release myself while were on the tarmac
4158,you cant even have ive heard you cant even have a mirror next to a, enter, laughs
4159,betta tank cause itll exhaust itself to death trying to beat its own ass this, you enter my brother, no its a potion but the potion bottle also just happens to have a
4160,is something that ive heard that i believe is true, squad,genie in it
4161, right, squad, so the plane lands and then once we taxi to the gate and then get
4162, hell try to fight himself so i said it was pointless but i dont, yeah youre telling me that youve made sugar flavored creamer,off and i make it to the toilet i sit down on it and then i can go but not
4163,think fish care right like a fish fish are in bags a lot of the time one, oh its so they made sugar flavored creamer,before that i chug it as im crossing the threshold of the plane and i say
4164,thing i dont think a fish is ever said is ugh this sucks like i think fish, okay,chug i wouldnt want it to be a lot of fluid i would want it to be a pretty
4165,are just like its fine, all right,small
4166, a fish in a bag theyre like well im in a bag thats the way it, okay, yeah even smaller than that a little vial and i just drink that
4167,goes i guess its zen, wait i have one,and then all pee goes away all poo goes away and then it doesnt come
4168, right he doesnt care, hold on hold on hold on,back until i make it to tallahassee which is my turn of phrase that i use
4169, he forgets the fish forgets the other end of the tank by the time it, i do, thats rude i just went to tallahassee it was lovely but thats my
4170,gets to it it gets the it swims to the other end and its like oh hell, and i want to kind of piggyback off of what griffin said,potion and its relevant cause i just flew today and there was stuff there
4171,yeah look back there a whole other part of the tank ive yet to go to, and this is kind of an alleyoop to justin,was stuff that happened
4172, weve told that weve done that before, please see where im going with this, things happen
4173, if my experience with fish is any indicator one thing you can try is, sugar creamer more like sugar kramer, things happen i know ive talked about this on the show before
4174,wait just a little bit like a month or so and the problem will just sort of,low quality seinfeld bass riff,and for some reason i was just like on fire today up in the air and i swear
4175,like sort itself out you dont even need to starve em out you can treat, laughs,to god i swear to god this is not a joke diagonal from me an older

4205,amateur production of my fair lady how do i decline politely he has, mmhmm, oh thats a good point justin spiderman potion is what i want
4206,handed out the flyer to me twice already, the the problem is is if you eat it and anyone sees you wont i dont, yeah so like he did in the comics where he drank the potion that
4207, thats from not so fair a lady in newcastle uck,even know that you so much get in trouble for eating the product,the magic man made in the forest
4208, i wish i hadnt seen it already that was so thoughtless of me, so much as everyone around you would be like what are you doing, and then he was able to turn into a spider i would like that
4209,cause i read pygmalion when i was fucking 12, thats not cooked,potion as well i would actually you know what id like 10 of that potion
4210, and i know all the different things in it and all the jokes and stuff, or worse what if you do it and everyones like oh thank god,so that i can uh you know do it 10 times
4211, i think you could probably just tell em that justin hates my fair,someone did it first and then just the whole floor erupts into, yeah
4212,lady and that would be enough to sort of waive it off like that tells them, just a grab and go everyones going crazy shoving those little circles in, now trav theres actually a yahoo answers user here who um
4213,everything they need to know,their mouths,well they said they wanted a potion that would take me places wherever i
4214, stinks on ice, its just bowelsloose,go without worrying of needing an airplane driving a vehicle taking a bus
4215, maybe if someone says hey do you wanna go see my fair lady, wait but what do you do with the defective ones why cant you eat,or heck even riding a bicycle or tricycle to reach certain destination
4216,you can say i cant i have a fucking cribbage game that day cause im,those,uh and then also a potion that would make me a millionaire a potion
4217,80 years old apparently no wait thats right im not 80 years old so no, uhhuh,that would make you a millionaire huh
4218,i will not see my fair lady, or oh hey bring a bag of uncooked ravioli from home have em put a, mm this is

4520,im considering putting up a sign that says pee however you like, so what do you for a living, laughs yeah i think what travis is trying to say is you can support the
4521, but if you pee standing up straight into the bowl you will be,im the person who puts the leaf next to the pate,things that you care about and that you want to be in the world and that support
4522,heard thoughts thats from a little too loud in alabama, i look forward to the robot apocalypse so much,means the world to us even uh you know no matter what level it is

4609, sorry i didnt mean to do that i cant afford to, for an hour,they cant see your private parts because of the bubbles
4610, what, laughs, or is bubble bath just totally pointless
4611, yes, you gotta hide em in plain sight get all the olds together have, yeah
4612, so anyway,em stand in the middle, you could not show you could not show the act of bathing in most

4618,network around 75 of that goes directly to the shows that you say you listen to, hell yeah, i do want to say this about bubble bath: i wish there was a off switch
4619,when you fill out the brief survey upon donating uh the rest goes to help fund, how about record some old persons sounds put that recorder in,once you board the bubble bath train
4620,uh the great work at maximum fun,like a closet right, you cant go back to water bath you simply cannot uh and it is for this
4621, its like the best value in entertainment i think, and then when they get there you open and theres the first clue,reason that my i used to do a draw a bubble bath for my son and i did it for a
4622, uh which includes us doing all manner of garbage i mean just like,and then theyre gonna follow that first clue,while and then um he started just requesting no bubbles um hes hes the
4623,videos and weird stuff other like weird recordings this year our wives once, cause i wrote it when i was 10 cause theyre old,only two year old that i know of whos like ill just do a water one this time
4624,again recorded an episode of mslmslm my sisterinlaw my sisterinlaw and, how wide are the ledges outside the windows,and every time i hate those bubbles because you cant turn them off they are
4625,me theres a new episode commentary featuring us and jd amato for episode, you dont know where im going with it,just always there once you do them

4631,featuring the view outside the max fun offices uh it is it is uh uh not about, cool thank you, and then when you want the bubbles in your fun bath to go away when
4632,the gifts those are nice its about supporting content that you feel should be in, we can go ahead and bring that down,the persons left the room and you laughs unintelligible your genitals to to
4633,the world what do you want to see more of do you want to see more nasty, house lights,really just just scuba around down there without being obfuscated by the suds
4634,superheroes, house lights please please house lights,then you pull the lever and this the floor of your tub opens up and it falls out of
4635, laughs battling it out wheezes, please oh no oh okay all right goodbye outlines of people,the house

4780,talk about the bonus content real quick, yes,put it sort of against your grannys thigh and the chair the surface and you just
4781, you can give 5 a month uh just our shows right there are one two, but i also think griffin um this person welcomed you into their,kind of start pushing that big balloon against her hiney uh its gonna get under
4782,three four five six seven eight nine ten,family,there eventually
4783, eleven bonus episodes of my brother my brother and me in there which, probably shared some james taylor branded popcorn with you,the question is what is there ddistracting her against this very obvious
4784,includes the uh ghost horse fugue for brotherhorns demo, fire and rain and butter and salt and that was,sensation thats the obvious question i know you think im a real goofball by
4785, by linmanuel miranda him him singing that demo iis in there uh the, i know but i theres no time and so they shared that,suggesting this
4786,one and only episode of big gulp live,experience with you and now even i think what youre feeling questionasker is a bond and you wanna break that with money and i get that you, another thing you need you need in this situation is a pill caddy full of
4787, is in the archives,feel like you owe them something maybe just hand her a 20 and walk,bees
4788, in there there is uh videos of us goofing on uh like educational,away, yeah and youre just gonna start opening those up one by one and once

4791,dungeons and dragons uh one time uh and he was a bard and it was really, whether they like it or not, um because its harder to catch a box full of bees if you open up a box

4793,access to all of it for donating 5 bucks a month um and it would re and it, i didnt like that sweater you knitted me for christmas,bees fly out
4794,just i think i think itit would really mean a lot to us, uh, people will be like that was not laughs
4795, guitar noises, like a cave school, unimpressive but if you throw a pill caddy for one week down and you
4796, car revving noises,  where they sat at like rock desks,then walk over to what youve just thrown down and one by one open all the
4797, i wanna munch, and they use pens made out of dinosaur bones,doors
4798, guitar noises i want to munch, and maybe maybe like books that are just big leaves all stuck, yeah

4800, unintelligible fuzz on that one and a little bit of british stank, rocks, now
4801, a little bit of acdc or akdk, big flat rocks theyll be like oh this is my tablet but its just, exactly the problem is that youve chosen a target who is maybe the
4802, dare,like a stone tablet,least mobile person at the event and so you need to confront yourself with the
4803, air conditioned dave coulier as they sometimes are known, yeah yeah yeah do that crosstalk oh stop stop shut up,reality that this thing this dog just is not going to hunt even no matter if

4881,skin especially uh uh people with young people with vaginas uh its not great, yeah but its a strong response that happens when you look at,in in the hot summer but the only bad thing is when it smashes like when

5044, this is forever uh lets get into the advice,lessons i learned in schools is that dont play in refrigerators you get stuck, oh yes
5045,i work in wildlife rehabilitation one weekend at this job i was cleaning one of,in them which is apparently a concern that not even my dad had to worry, do you have movies
5046,the owls enclosures and,about when he was five, miss my boy i hope the sticky men arent gonna get him but um
5047, do you know whats irritating, so why do i remember that so well,could i take a airplane wine nap now please here i go
5048, why one of the reasons i really dont enjoy you guys and while this, oh my god youre right, nasally voice all right whats up where are the polka boys
5049,is, first ooh someone was a bad boy is not a piece of information,thats nice anyone holdin is anybody holding
5050, much more of a professional its more of a professional relationship at,but probably just a guess or observation like no ones ever like walked, i havent smoked weed since 1977
5051,this point than a familial one,into a police office or like a detective office to say what happened and the, yeah
5052, is because i was in my head thinking like this is sounding good,detective is like well seems like somebody was a bad boy what no, why why do we talk about home alone so much
5053, i was i was i was already congratulating myself for how well i was, yes they were doing some disrespectful dunks, so much
5054,reading it and not stumbling or messing it up it all and then you fuckin, ohh, um okay i have a yahoo here can we talk about it
5055,dillweeds, like they would go to dunk but it was more just like they were, it was sent in by a few folks
5056, uh yeah it was like i just wheezes wanted to finish it with like my,barely getting to the rim you know they were kind of rolling the ball off, yes thank you uh uh everybody who sent this one in its yahoo
5057,streak deep voice ill try again,their fingers to get it in and people were like no you cant do that youre, he lived underwater where theres no resistance how could he get so
5058, i work in wildlife rehabilitation one weekend at this job i was cleaning,disrespecting the god of hoops,buff
5059,one of the owls enclosures and when i turned to leave she attacked the back of, funkier funkier dunks,im not sure that your terminology is right here because i think water is all
5060,my head she didnt draw blood but i definitely felt her talons graze my scalp it, no slick beans is the name of the company but then cool coffee,resistance if thats the logic that youre using then uh merfolks who live in the
5061,was startling as fuck and since then the owl and i have had a strained,is the shop they have not related at all slick beans does not handle,water would be getting jacked from all the swimming that they do cause
5062,relationship i feel like she hates me how do i learn to trust this animal again,actually any beans of any kind its just the name of the business,exercise folks thats just exercise
5063,and thats from living in fear in louisiana, but i was trying my best, okay so he
5064, mmm, uhhuh yeah, okay so he has a sort ofhe has a webbing and its in his mouth and
5065, mmm mmm, you were dunking but you didnt wash your hands first and we,we dont see that but when he does extend his jaws wide open you see the
5066, sure,saw that so no thank you,webbing get in there and he does swallow up a million things and you know
5067, you can you can try to do something behind an owls back but its just, the ball was teetering on the rim and you burped and blew on it to,they were trying to play the xylophone or whatever and then they did get eaten
5068,gonna turn right the fuck around and see it with that crazy head they have,push the ball into it no thank you, um but howd he get so jacked up though hes very strong i dont
5069, oh god, laughing we saw derek come out of the bathroom without,know if you guys remember the movie but he has a very strong upper body and
5070, god school was tough huh,washing his hands and then go straight to the parking lot and start,torso
5071, yeah if this but like if this owl had wanted to fuck you up,dribbling no thank you for all we know hes already dribbled twice, yeah
5072, youd be fucked up, thats a pretty hip business justin, yeah
5073, this was the this was the owl sending a message heres where you, well, exact well what you just said is wrong theyre all fuckin muscle man
5074,youve already ruined it youve already botched this as bad as you possibly can, actually i was gonna say he didnt do any jumping but he jumps,the dolphins are all fuck muscle i do not know if you ever touched one of these
5075,if an owl does this you have to s an owl attacks your scalp spin around in one,up and down when he gets to the top of the steps and its pretty good,bad boys but it is basically a muscle rocket
5076,smooth motion and punch it in the face, oh shit, yeah
5077, and then its like dominance respect hey hey respect, im so sick of it being so this market is flooded with flubber, the dolphin doesnt have a six pack

5243,legs and she just collapsed like oh my bones my terrible weakened bones, okay,that they had been um horribly maligned by his two older brothers who he
5244, magic, but weve already paid for all the mugs,trusted very much into eating uncooked uh fettuccine every time we went to

5246,like just magic that doesnt really move the needle for us, no everybodys got coffee but the question is where do you put, i do hope that i would have had the good sense not to eat uncooked

5710,convince my coworkers that robot babysitting is a valid part of my job and, mr tigershark you are telling me that the animal that best,no that you can feel confident about but
5711,im not just wasting time and thats from robot wrangler in richmond,represents you that best sums up what it means to be justin is a tiger, but if i could have had my first marijuana experience be with my

5717,be this is i think the first of what is sure to be a long line and everincreasing number of questions about robot interactions that were sure to, if we were going to invent surnames now i think it would be like, right if i
5718,have in the oncoming years and i just want to make sure we have a,so like my name is travis right say i had a son named robert right, if id had the opportunity to look up at someone and ask is this
5719,respectful tone that we can feel good about no matter sort of whos,now that persons name is robert travis and then they have a kid named,gonna be forever id want it to be my father
5720,running the show if you know what i mean,like edward and thats gonna be named edward robert travis and then, yeah man whats forever whats time

6235, so that is kind of the gag of that of that bit, laughs,wild way to say it i guess its yahoo answers so it has to be in the form of a
6236, yeah its sometimes its a metaphorical cyborg dog bike like a, and not like oh you got it wrong eat this oldass dusty,question if i am a 14 year old and my family has a guinea pig is he my
6237,particularly weighty insult hurled at that person that was crosstalk,chocolate,brother or son
6238, big shirt, i do like this envisioned scenario though where like you, if i am a 14 year old and my family has a guinea pig is he my
6239, a training shirt he wont need that all the time,surreptitiously scarf all the chocolate and then like six months from now,brother or son
6240, yeah shirts you could wear with your dog thats what big dog,your new boss is like i remember when i traded over this job with the old, no obviously obviously no update: i understand that
6241,shirts have been this entire time,boss they handed me a file folder that had very important information and,technically he is neither since i am not a guinea pig i think were talking
6242, no problem,on one piece of paper was just written you know susan has the chocolate,about structurally in the caste system of the family youre drawing the
6243, ill take the fear im your shirt ill take the fear,in case we ever do the presentation again and i know its been four years,family tree of from which branch does you know little bing bing dangle
6244, jerome let me wick your fear jerome ill wick your fear,but susan i assume you still have that chocolate like a responsible, the guinea pig
6245, i recently decided to patronus fuck,employee and then you have to deal with the ramifications of your, yes
6246, fuck i recently decided to patronize my local concert hall on a,scarfing, where is he at where does he live is he a son or a brother to the
6247,whim arriving only a few months before the concert started, mmhm,14yearold
6248, whatd i say, or wait no, all right
6249, laughs hey you guys throwin a concert here in june, and you know what maybe thats how you get that big raise, but if im the one that picked him out at the pet land or whatever
6250, uh i decided to patronize my local concert hall on a whim arriving,youve been angling for,i dont know if they do guinea pigs at your local shelter but if they do
6251,only a few minutes before the concert started as i was approaching the, is the new boss comes in is like were probably gonna have to,obviously thats the ideal scenario um im pretty sure they sell these bad
6252,box office to purchase a ticket a woman intercepted me and all but insisted,spend money to buy chocolate again cause were doing that presen oh,guys at target uh but if youre the one that picked him out from the target
6253,i use the spare ticket she had as one of her family members was not able to,what a waste,lineup after shopping through isaac mizrahis new collection i think youre
6254,make it before i could consider the consequences of doing so i graciously,and youre like uh no actually,the father of this pig
6255,accepted and she sat me among her family members in the second row of, laughs, yeah this is the
6256,the stage for a very intimate twohour concert because of the proximity of, oh, a capybara i would just go right and throw myself in the river and
6257,the stage im worried that these were rather expensive tickets um should, oh lets buy some chocolate if were gonna buy chocolate we,let myself i would drift away until i found a new home that this big big rat
6258,i try to compensate her somehow she also invited me to her church do i,need money lets go to the money zone,didnt live in
6259,have to start going there do i need to buy her a ticket to something now,money zone theme plays, huh
6260,thats from a ticket tagalong in texas, bad news criminals, i cannot tell you the number of times ive gone downstairs from my
6261,i dont even think how could you not tell us what the concert was i, yeah hey all you criminals listening i know youre like i can,office to get a nice cold can of lacroix from the refrigerator and opened it
6262,thought thats like was gonna be the whole thing im so disappointed,look at mcelroyfamily and click on tours and see when travis is gonna be,up and had to fish my dang oldest brother out of there
6263, james taylor,out of town but bad news for you because i have ring and its gonna let, yeah yes absolutely
6264, mmhm,me know if you try to break into my house and then youre going to prison, its not an ongoing problem
6265, mmhm, also important to note and ive got a big dog and a little dog, yeah they have
6266, i feel like you went to a concert going to a concert without,but mostly the big dog is what matters here in this context uh because, no they had those like metal latches that would shut and it would
6267,knowing what concert youre going to see is the single wildest act i have,heres the thing,hold the door shut and they were only on the outside so they have to
6268,ever heard of any human doing um that would be akin to mailing 100 to, but i also have a dog yeah no im also saying in addition to,remove the doors off these old refrigerators so dumb kids couldnt like crawl
6269,amazon and saying eh whatever surprise me im in im in im,brother judge dredd brother dredd now i have a big dog,inside of them at the city dump and then the good thing about that is
6270,down to and make me uh ill video myself opening it and you could,anyways ring helps you stay connected to your home anywhere in the,ready to go hot and fresh coffin just like right there i guess and thats
6271,watch my reaction,world thanks to hd video and twoway audio features on ring devices its,not ideal obviously
6272, its its insane you deserve the worst that life has to offer you,one of my favorite things if im somewhere and someone rings my,but on the subject of if it is an ongoing concern that would be wild
6273,but,doorbell which is a ring doorbell or just like somebody walks up to my,knowing what i just said out loud if mr frigidaire like had people coming
6274, laughs but i will say,door not only do i get a notification from my phone that says hey,up to him like dog youve gotta do the kids are climbing into there
6275, it is exactly um i will say this: you went there to open yourself,someones at the door but it also gives me a chance to see who came up,theyre playing fortnite and then going to take what they call dumpster
6276,up to the adventure of life one of the many wonderful adventures this world,even if i miss the notification even if i miss the ringing of the doorbell,breaks and theyre climbing in the fridges and they are just getting just
6277,has in store for us and it seems like the door has been opened to a story,and i can talk its a twoway communication i can say like oh you can,wrecked out there and mr frigidaires not hearing that like evil
6278,where maybe you find a family that has always wanted a child like yourself,just leave that at the door or like no thank you or whatever its a,laughter yes
6279,  and you find renewal in the blood of jesus christ or something,great way to answer the door even when youre not at home i am a huge, yeah we had a lot of stuff
6280,and its like your story that you started with this like random thing and now,fan of it i highly recommend it i like i said i have two i have one on, well travis i dont think he does it in the chorus i dont think he
6281,youre just gonna close the door on it i think you need to repay these,my front door and one on my back door,swaps out the chorus its like singing lets really dig into the berlin wall
6282,people by becoming a part of their family, yeah and one on my zeppelin um and if you want to check it, right
6283, like a surrogate member of their family be there at thanksgiving,out as a listener we have a special offer for you own a ring starter kit, this podcast is a refrigerator that ive been trapped inside of for
6284,at easter whatever,available right now with a video doorbell and motionactivated floodlight,nine years
6285, whatever they theyre down with yeah youre gonna repay,cam the starter kit has everything you need to start building a ring of, you really cracked this one wide open man yeah so
6286,them somehow until one of them you know therell become a moment,security around your home just go to ringcom its ringcommybrother, yeah
6287,when they need a ticket for something and then you can get the hell out of,thats ringcommybrother, the other possibility is that they were doing nasty dunks but when
6288,dodge unintelligible, yeah,it came time for the funk to happen they were kind of phoning it in they
6289, hey brittany we all hate dylan, boom,were kind of
6290, im out weve hated him the whole time hey kevin your, and theyre in the box, and so you guys are assuming that somebody went boom shaka
6291,haircut sucks, gravelly squad,laka the glass explode im saying that maybe they were disrespecting the
6292, yeah yeah i think so griff i think so, squad,hoop by which i mean they were doing super bad at basketball and
6293, i think that they, no that would be weird,embarrassing the sport itself embarrassing the hoop
6294, you would assume some sort of hunting apprenticeship right, oh wow, that was an impotent dunk jeremy
6295, but that would be i feel like cumbersome cause youd have one, its in his blood, the folks over here at slick beans the folks over here at cool
6296,dude whos like great at hunting and all of the kids would wanna train with, what is any of this,coffee they get nine feet high theyre so rad
6297,him, ooh, youre embarrassing us in front of slick beans youre banned from
6298, so you would need to maybe educate them en masse which i feel, okay,the hoop everyone is
6299,like is all were talking about right like here is how you here is how, hey so just so i can get this hunk of shit straight they said that, theres small business on small business defense yeah
6300,you beat a velociraptor with a stealth attack or whatever,they said they said they wanted to think of an idea that no one had ever, i dont wanna dunk with no
6301, fuck this is im writing this down for the cavemen uh the,done and like well were revolutioning the idea of a quickservice, i dont want to dunk with no pee ball
6302,geico cavemen comedy series,restaurant so we went with sandwiches, yeah
6303, okay fine, ive eaten at lord quiznos, yeah
6304, yeah, what, and another possibility is that in an attempt to get a leg up on the
6305, ugh i would i would like to take a moment uh ive been led, dont talk with the lord of cheetos,slick beans some select members of your staff your coworkers your
6306,uh onto the internet um and i know that we need to do the moneyzone, ooh,cohorts did go out and steal the basketball energy from muggsy bogues
6307,and everything but um id like to take a moment to talk about the tv, yeah yeah yeah,and charles barkley and uh michael jordan although hes playing
6308,series cavemen and the things that ive learned about it from the wikipedia, yeah,baseball so like does he even still have it and um sylvester stallone i
6309,page um and i know what youre thinking a sitcom that is about the, laughs,mean sylvester the cat and sylvester stallone
6310,geico cavemen that briefly aired in 2007 it doesnt seem all that funny but, im sorry lord john montagu, but hes got a big hey listen slag fucking rocky hes got huge
6311,listen to this description, it is not betwixt two slices i cannot eat it with my hands,muscles thats gotta help you jump yeah
6312,from the synopsis cavemen have prominent brow ridges and more body, maybe if perhaps the chipped potatoes were between two slices, and hes got big muscles on his legs to push the earth away to get
6313,hair than homo sapiens but beyond superficial differences in appearance,of bread,up to the hoop so
6314,they actually are not that much different from modern humans in terms of, i did kinda like that holiday turkey with cornbread stuffing, ketogenic flubber
6315,behavior or physical abilities male cavemen are very hairy have thick long, mm, to avoid like you know fda prying eyes they have to call their
6316,beards and wear their hair shoulderlength a cavewoman that appeared on, you mean griffin,company something else as a front so they do apple and thats what
6317,the show also had a prominent brow ridge and comparatively more body hair, well i dont want to do that,theyve actually been this whole time
6318,than a modern human female, because heres the thing, yeah so ive got a whole like ive got a whole dossier and ive
6319, some cavemen attempted to pass as homo sapiens this is f,keyboard typing,sent it to justin and travis many many times before about how apple does
6320,about the series some cavemen attempted to pass as homo sapiens by, griffins point if i picture 175 gallon jugs of water i would look at,flubber
6321,shaving their body hair other cavemen call them shavers the central,it and be like wow thats a lot of water right but i, huh
6322,humor of the show is that cavemen characters are not brutish primates but, i do have a strong suspicion, i do im going to step in here though and say i cannot think of
6323,fully integrated into whitecollar jobs the central cavemen characters are, that if you showed me one container that could contain 175,a conglomeration that altogether throughout the history of time has been
6324,modern citydwellers they must enth they must endure racial epithets,gallons,more disrespectful to the basketball hoop and the game itself and the
6325,such as magger a pun based on cromagnon fuck, i would be like thats not nearly as big as i thought it would be,people that play it they will climb up on ladders and they will dunk you
6326, fuck this is funny damn im laughing already and thats before, i dont know how big that is,know confetti into the audience while another person scores a three from
6327,i get to the last line of the synopsis according to producer joe lawson the, man it even autofilled as i typed it out in google i typed 175,the concession stand that is hugely disrespectful to this game
6328,show was originally going to be set in newport news due to its proximity to,space g and it was like allon fish tank, they do a basketball jump over like five kids and i just i didnt
6329,the water then the setting changed to atlanta georgia and finally san, this feels like something you would need to have at a restaurant,see my friend michael jordan doing that during his big game the sixth game
6330,diego california,so kids could look at it while you waited for your chair,of the series that he did so well in so you know i dont know
6331,the 13 episodes of the series were made uh the final six did not, also think of how versatile it is yes yes you can put fish in it of, oh god
6332,  air on traditional television and if you can do a little math that,course yes you could also perhaps put a reptile in there maybe even an, but then he said oh arent i and then his water broke and
6333,means that cavemen got seven episodes which is again one more,amphibian but you could also store your clothes in it you could keep all,then they brought out the bed and then over the next twelve hours
6334,episode laughter one more episode than our tv show um but good,your loose change in it you could just buy a whole bunch of boxes of, he pushed that basketball valiantly slowly bravely
6335,news is all the episodes aired in australia,cereal and dump it all in there with milk and have it be like a big cereal, no epidural just raw dogging it
6336, the transition fuck,trough for a party, yeah and so hes just no juice just raw dogging it and then
6337,moneyzone theme plays, yes yes,when it did come out just three pointer extremely disrespectful display
6338, im gonna talk about squarespace now youve got a great idea, theres so many things like think about tell your dad this say, it was beautiful beautiful yeah it was beautiful like little slice of
6339,somewhere inside you i believe that all people are formed by their life,dad think about all the stupid shit youve bought that only does one thing,life and it was you know its the circle life and thats great but you got
6340,experience to put something anything into the world that only they can,and it was really expensive,you know placenta on the basketball and thats disrespectful because
6341,create, you dumb piece of shit,thats that ones cashed i dont mean to be im not you know im not a
6342, right now right now yes travis even you, right and what do you even do with it you know you dont i,prude ive seen the majesty of this process irl first hand with my own

6642,nasty dunk they were taking it to the hole, or android for free uh browse local restaurants and,around in a big block of ice and he swings it around on the chain like a
6643, maybe this is someone who is playing a very high minded game of,businesses and track your delivery you know,mace and he smashes people who gets in the way of his big cars and
6644,d of basketball d youre telling the other company that you were supposed, uh theyre the largest ondemand network in the known universe,coffee

6816,of all those i think the best start is cannonballing into a pool cool are you, yes no we yeah i think as long as you say it as a statement of fact,the va i imagine that job can get kind of exhausting depending on what
6817,doing that in slacks are you wearing jeans and cannonballing into the pool,rather than im travis mcelroy right rather than im travis mcelroy,your role is there and so its obviously not appropriate its not a football
6818,no youre not,dont make it sound like a question statement im travis mcelroy,team and even then its probably not even super appropriate to get a butt
6819, can i do neither can i go about my day, laughs griffin hates his pubes i wanna tell you guys a story this is,smack that lets you know okay next play were gonna do a hail mary and

6843,survival mode if you attack it first,a urinal became open and they directed me towards a urinal, sure sure
6844, but it will always attack you at night in survival mode, and all i could think is like thats what i would have done laughs,music stops

6868,definitely come up with shit i am doing if i was only called to do that every,but im a fairly broad 510 and i felt like a tiny child in his presence like i,nudge it was a little kiss it was a bump

6879, you got it right hey do you want to hear ive got the first few,i guarantee they porked it at some point,sometimes maybe youve heard about it the one with the hats and its
6880,chapters of catcher 2 done do you want to hear a sample, oh thats fun,the most exciting like 90 seconds in sports because these horses get
6881, thank you so much for listening to our podcast my brother my, oh maybe like when you get to that sex scene like text your grandma,together and they race and we make jokes about it every year but this time
6882,brother and me an advice show for the modern era we hope youve,and say like i really like this episode but i was confused by that one scene,the jokes on us it feels like because
6883,enjoyed yourself sorry about all the very obscure references this time,where they seem to be just slamming their bodies into each other whats that, the maximum security which is the horses name everybody was
6884, lot of placenta talk just some recommended reading for this,about,like thats gonna win its owned by quote billionaire philanthropist
6885,weeks episode you can google billy joel and google um, yeah what was even happening there whats that what is that did,gary west and gary west raises himself a good motherfucking pony and
6886, joes apartment which was a,that hurt them they seemed to be in pain of some sort i couldnt place it are,maximum security won the florida derby which is a joke its a joke race
6887, joes apartment was a movie based on who was it like a,they okay,that we all like to poke fun at when were sitting there in our cool hats
6888, like a skit its a short its like between show like commercial, are they okay what happened,and sure enough maximum security car engine noise like a fucking car
6889,basically on mtv its wild okay but it was a movie they also did roger, option two you text your grandma and just be like i really liked this,like two horses
6890,ebert wrote at the time joes apartment would be a very bad comedy,episode especially the part where they fucked,this guy ran and won the big race and then he crossed the finish line and
6891,even without the roaches, okay what would you do then what would you do,they poured all the milk on his head poured the milk on the jockeys head
6892, thats wild, but then you would worry like if you said like i thought the car chase,and everybodys like yeah the one who was supposed to win won and
6893, right it wouldnt make much sense i would guess,was really good and oh that negotiation scene was so tense and then grandma,everybody got a nominal amount of money except the people who placed
6894, his acting wings,writes back like whatd you think about the fucking,stupid bets on weak horses
6895,we have new i dont know if we talked about it but we have we, okay then what if what if its a little more subtle and its just like,but then one of the horses was like hey to its manager hey you
6896,mentioned it last time but now theyre on sale we have a ton of shows that,whatd you think about the rest of it,should say something and then the team behind this horse named
6897,have gone on sale recently my knowledge of lets see im gonna look at, and then a winky face,country house the worst horse name ive ever heard was like
6898,that to tell you all how those shows are doing hold on one second okay, and maybe like an eggplant, was like uh hey uh hey ref run back the tapes if you dont
6899,were gonna be in cleveland cincinnati nashville indianapolis atlanta, oh i thought you meant like maybe got like an apartment together,mind and apparently maximum security a whiff of skin
6900,orlando washington dc pittsburg philadelphia brooklyn chicago and, i dont know if youre live texting it back and forth, had a lot of fun out there a whiff of skin rubbed up against
6901,minneapolis you can find all those at bitlybecomethemonster because it is, oh yeah yeah yeah,country house they disqualified the fuckin horse country house was a
6902,the become the monster tour i know some of those have already sold out, man i sure do hope that ari and e hug it out like im im betting its,65toone long shot this horse is a fucking joke i couldve beaten this
6903,im pretty sure dont quote me on this pittsburg and brooklyn and maybe,either ballers or entourage thats my bet,horse in a footrace but his team was like um actually i got touched
6904,minneapolis uh have sold out already so please if you would like to come, mm,and so it was in second place and then it got the win and then there had to
6905,see us tickets are going fast so please dont wait go to, okay,be something going on because 65toone thats so much money if you bet
6906,bitlybecomethemonster and buy tickets to those shows so we can see you, mmhmm yes,on that one even though youre wrong because it lost because it came in
6907,some will be the uh adventure zone shows most are mbmbam shows so, yes,second

6909, of course,johnson like hey were good friends right will you come see my community,and shit and then it oh boop and then it got kicked out of the race
6910, damn thats good my names justin mcelroy,theater production of cats or something,forever for doing that
6911, this has been my brother my brother and me kiss your dad,and dwayne the rock johnson said uh i cant uh im in a new show that i, pissed off just say pissed off
6912,square on the lips,need to film, i dont think it was a good decision overall
6913,theme song plays,and theyre like oh whats the show about, yeah i think thats how i would encapsulate most
6914,maximumfunorg,and hes like its uh called ballers and, i would say factually statistically yes all that tracks
6915,comedy and culture, and its definitely a real show, oh no well
6916,artist owned,and then theyre like well i cant wait to see previews for it, listen and if they touch the blue ones out its the whole point
6917,listener supported,and he was like uh and then he had to go to someone and say please help,of the light cycles is to make them bump listen fuckin rubbing is racing
6918, hello everybody and welcome to my brother my brother and me,me make previews but we cant say what day or time its on we dont want,these horses are gonna touch out there on a sloppy course i dont
6919,an advice show for the modern era im your oldest brother justin mcelroy,people to watch it and so it only exists in preview form,understand like i disagree with everything else hes ever said but this is
6920, and uh boy its an exciting day the tingles on this end are just, ooh,factual
6921,whoo its electric, it might be ballers, well that happened of course in the 1996 derby when murder boy
6922, mmhmm, yeah,lived up to his name
6923, mmhmm, yeah oh it seems like they hired an intimacy director this seems very, no they did book the jockey on that one which is good because
6924,soft upbeat music plays in background,realistic,he was really goading him along that was the right decision but
6925, youth, yeah, no but he was accomplice and everybody knows horses can be led
6926, oh wakeupandsmell, its like a fight choreographer griffin but instead of the two ham shanks,to you cant lead a horse to water but you can make it murder somebody
6927, thefuture,punching each other you choreograph,if you say the magic spell in its ear on the racetrack so
6928, grindupthedaywith can we say it at the same time or just a, the two ham shanks, thats pretty close
6929,magical, yes, yeah sure man
6930, beanjuice, no no this is a real thing an intimacy director is hired to choreograph, heres a quote from bill mott whos country houses trainer that
6931, hey griffin youre still cutting this out right,love scenes and really any kind of physical intimacy,lucky son of a gun
6932, okay good as long as youre still editing guys im so fuckin, yes love scenes griffin not just physical love but perhaps other kinds, bill maher says uh imitating bill maher you know heres the
6933,scared about this,of love so that everyone on set feels comfortable and its realistic,thing about uh the liberals cause i am one but dont they stink guys
6934, it seemed like a really good idea but like beanjuice, laughs i think thats the opposite of them making everyone feel,yeah
6935, saying it is tough right,comfortable griffin,cool
6936, beanjuice, huh,no bill mott says with regards to luis saez who was the jockey on
6937, griffin we talked about this we have to be fucking committed or, the thing is is i think its easy to assume that youre hearing the sounds,maximum security the most powerful wonderful horse that ever lived on
6938,nobodys gonna buy it,from tv but griffin what if the tv just talks,this earth and he said of saez i think the horse did this on his own i
6939, okay okay clap it in, uhhuh,dont think luis saez did anything intentionally hes a friend of mine he
6940, and yes, and its just like hello gretta,rides with me my heart actually aches for them ive been on the other
6941, laughs you got it in two it is a well not a coffee, and youre like tv turn because heres the thing my amazon alexa,end of this plenty of times just not in the kentucky derby
6942,music stops,talks to me sometimes,eat my whole asshole bill mott you know bill motts like thanks luis i
6943, it seems like it would be a coffee, what if this just went a step further and was just like hey gretta,dont give a fuck like what happened i got the money i got the money
6944, yeah thats not,and youre like hey tv please turn on picture and the tv was like no,my horses nuts are now worth a billion dollars a piece everything kicks

6946, laughing, uh no tv i think id just rather watch it could you show it to me,and uh my good friend luis saez who i did pay 100000 to kick the other
6947, theyre gonna see right the fuck through that,please,horse like hes playing fuckin road rash
6948, laughs, no no tv its totally fine my mom left but before she did she said, it depends right were talking about nature versus nurture you
6949, its a pay what you can that was bad for a mug right,and tell tv its okay to see the dirty parts so,grow up in the fields its like oh man its all about just being free and if
6950, cause theyre fixed cost, and then took her out for ice cream,we find some wild oats hell yeah but when you grow up in this
6951, it could be anything and it could be anything other than coffee, ooh they dipped fries in it how risque,environment with somebody every day yelling at you rubbing is racing
6952, please buy the mugs please just buy the mugs, uh so,rubbing is racing get out there and trade some paint motherfucker then
6953, its all banked on this guys we just thought maybe beanjuice, well not if you dont shake around a bunch,these of course theyre going to just push on the field
6954,music stops, cmon, yeah
6955, laughs guys real quick we forgot to get a url for the mugs, oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, i think what would be cool is if instead of weapons you just
6956,what should i get, mmhmm,what is there like 30 horses in this fuckin race take 15 of em at the
6957, i cant get beanjuicecom i cant get beanjuicecom, okay,starting line and you turn them 180 degrees
6958, thats so bad thats so bad, you did not think he said that, and now we go and hopefully on pretty much the complete
6959, beanjuicebrothers is so much more to type i can get, he twice he repeated himself,opposite side of the track theres going to be a sort of collision field a sort
6960,beanjuicehorse thats nothing, from a mix from a mix griffin,of collision
6961, i typed in whoa i can get brotherjuicecom which i may just pick, wait what is happening, sort of a collision zone every half lap were gonna end up
6962,up as long as im shopping, i dont care for this at all,entering into the collision zone and you really need to sort of get around
6963, im just gonna add that to the cart real quick, oh a pud a delicious pud,that and i think its just last horse standing
6964,music resumes, we all do, that you would now explain
6965, how bout beanjuicemugs4salecom, oh i see, yeah
6966, okay perfect, i also would say i while i appreciate uh the scientific nature of this, we could do 29 little horses and one big powerful horse that is
6967, beanjuicemugs the number 4 seems easier thats quicker to type,question youre missing out on the enjoyment of the pudding like if this did,  thats got a mighty mighty hunger that can only be satisfied in
6968, so you can just try that link itll take you right to the mugs its a,work you wouldnt mix it together in your tummy and then like say like mmm,one dark way
6969,new brand a new aw fuck,like thatit would not become pudding, 300 horses is really good trav
6970, heres my first question what did we do, right it wouldnt become pudding at the point at which it is important, yeah itll be tight if the track was made out of just slick stainless
6971,my wife thinks im bad at napkins she claims this because whenever i go,that it is pudding which is just if not more so prior to going in your mouth,steel and then it sort of sloped inward like it sloped towards the center of
6972,out to eat a place where you have to get your own napkins i do not the, let me throw myself down this set of stairs and then i will have had,the track so it would collect all the good horse grease that would be
6973,reason i dont is because someone always gets napkins and they inevitably,pudding let me shake up my tummy,laughing generated by these 300 beautiful animals just walking all over
6974,grab more than they need then i swoop the unused napkins as needed, im ready to make,each other just catch all that grease in a pan in the middle and then the
6975,and life goes on, laughs,winner gets to eat it for power
6976, she maintains this is rude behavior im maintaining its napkinefficient whos right in this and thats from nipping napkins wow, wait what there are very few foods laughs where the flavor isnt, okay
6977,thats actually mm,designed for the mouth, im telling you man if you really wanna sell race island you gotta
6978, i never i never grab napkins, uhhuh,get the word horse in the title
6979, im just realize sitting here thinking about that unless im dining, uh yeah, race island: a horse show this fall on abc
6980,alone i never grab napkins because i assume my wife got napkins, i would say any carbonated beverage where once again a beverage isnt, race island: helicopters
6981, they got you they got you,a food i get that but where where you are almost guaranteed to make burpies,its horses though
6982, can i talk about this has led me to a serious situation regarding, okay,yeah but we watched em with the helicopters
6983,panera bread that i wanted to hit you guys with this is a big problem for, snorts, all right
6984,me and i want to talk you guys through it i go to panera bread at the, laughs, god that was a lot of horse work we just did there good work
6985,mall right you know the one, whoa whoa whoa yours have this in em this is so great,boys
6986, you know the panera bread im thinking of, gruff voice itll really drive me off or whatever, oh theyve been begging for it too
6987, justins place so the last two times ago time before last i went, gruff voicekeep going now shake it, this is fuckin this is like a backwards mr hollands opus that i
6988,into panera bread go in with my family my family we walk into panera, gruff voiceyoure gonna shake it like a polaroid picture kevin,really enjoy its mr hollands nopeus and i really like it a lot
6989,bread we are in the back of the line at this point a gentleman walks up, gruff voiceim out of pudding mix, teach a kid to hang art and he might become a docent or
6990,to us and asks where wed like to sit, munch munch munch,something somewhere
6991, laughing at panera bread, oh at the last minute he remembers gruff voice aw oh no, that theres a job
6992, and then asked if well need a high chair and says hell find a spot, i think and i dont know maybe maybe uh im in the wrong here, no no
6993,for us and put a high chair there okay,but i think its way weirder to be sitting there with, um you can dress yourself up like a big child and then see if they
6994, thats problem one because i would like to pick where i am going, with because you have two options if you keep your eyes open one:,bully you and then if they ride off on their skateboard after doing so
6995,to sit at panera bread you have taken that from me you have taken my,stare straight ahead,youre like okay that seems like a popular and i could be with that
6996,agency and this is extremely problematic second, which is after a long period of time weird, yeah
6997, second yes exactly travis second thing that comes is i go up, two: track what theyre doing with your eyes which is even weirder, yeah like shit like shit
6998,and order my food i go back to the table with my pager thats supposed to, yes, and then if they dont say anything or if theyre like lets get you
6999,buzz when my salad and my familys food which is two grilled cheese, i think um youve given me this is i think a fun thing that you could,to the bathroom and clean lets find a teacher

7091,off to see the lizard by jimmy buffett plays,euphemism for vomit i would aw man i gotta go garf, but i could go outside and die on top of where a dinosaur is
7092, now this is a segment where we talk about uh jimmy buffett, especially when you consider that one of my favorite like uh, and then 100 years from now somebody find my bones and
7093,selling weed,abomination words dunkaccino is such a great word that i love saying and,theyre like well lets keep on pushin and then in the same way im
7094, and any time jimmy buffett sells weed or weedrelated products,then,sure this person when theyre digging and they find dinosaur bones theyre
7095,were gonna feature it in off to see the lizard this new segment, so theyre legit these arent your bandwagon garfieldjustin: oh no they know theyre gonna get the brand right,probably like well lets excavate the stomach cause maybe it ate a
7096, listen what am i a music professor listen im just a simple man,knowing garfields penchant for italian food they thought garfield would be the,person and we could find them inside there somewhere and then get a
7097,whos reading a simple press release that is headlined titled jimmy buffett,perfect pitch man for their brand of scooter pizza i guess,double get a twofer

7099, its very good, we never see scenes of him like at a fancy restaurant enjoying like a,work in and on your way back to the site theres a whole unearthed
7100, now coral reefer that has been jimmy buffetts backing band,like bolognese or something like he,tyrannosaurus rex youre not gonna be like ugh the bones are so big

7109, and probably through the dark web james said it never dawned,pizza is like the the outline of his face which looks to be an impossible shape, thats it there it is right to each other
7110,on me that coral reefer would be anything other than a cool name for a,to roll pizza out into so every one of these motherfuckers must be like hand, whats up

7259,from us cause we did call ours a tv show and that streaming service,good this is so much better than the shit im creating now, this is a really delicate and sensitive question and we should be
7260,doesnt even exist anymore, it was a good turkey hand,very mindful of that while we talk about it and i think when you are talking
7261, thank you, mmhmm,to her parents about this delicate thing i think there will be a moment when
7262, i adore this show i think that it really i think satire almost, a real joke that threeyearold travis told,they are disappointed but then when they find out what an amazing deal
7263,doesnt feel right to me it feels like a real genuine examination of like, i know,you got on this vasectomy i dont know
7264,where superheroes would fit in our world and like what we still need them, yes, i dont know how they could be upset anymore
7265,for and what that means in a way thats i think a lot more thoughtprovoking than i sort of expected from the tick, yeah i try not to do that anymore though just cause of my back, did you say 100 fuckin dollars
7266, and people can see this now is that right,you know when i was three, holy shit yeah

7270, laughs, i remember that and i also remember and i dont know why they, this would be like you going to your parents when youre 15 and
7271, folks listen dont hesitate if our experiences taught us,didnt credit it as based off a true story like it originally said on the,being like so just so you all know i got the surgery to remove that bone in
7272,everything its that streaming services can collapse overnight you never,manuscript when i wrote it of like this is my life,your arm that makes you go to college so that wont be happening

7278, okay perfect,their size,and youd be like scoffs you think thats a killer deal and then you are
7279, perfect, cause like right now if an elephant tried to go into an office,gonna tell him about your cheap vasectomy that you got in the basement of
7280, you saw that as sort of an invitation to plug your other podcast,building it would just be a fiasco right the hallways would be too narrow,a fuckin dicks sporting goods which is funny in a lot of ways
7281,okay see i shouldve been more clear,the doors are too small, its very very good
7282, yeah okay laughing i can see where the disconnect happened, but this is like a world in which the elephant can get in an elevator, yeah

7518, and everyone loves its just harder for you to do so you dont, heres the thing hes so uptight hes so uptight,in my mind this is the perfect stance but for some reason when i show
7519, no i got it uh so sings munch squad theme i wish i could do, and you know what before you feel bad about it hes been,this stance my friends think i cant fight seeing it i cant imagine now
7520,it with strings that would be more appropriate in its twilight,embezzling from the school i just wanna i didnt want anybody writing in,we are fullgrown adults but we dont dare find out it could get ugly fast
7521, sings romantically softly i want to munch,and saying like i am a principal and someone made me eat rancid shit,and tbh i dont have much fighting experience so im just hoping to get
7522, singing i want to munch,powder and i felt terrible about it for days like well youre probably not,perspective from fighters is my stance actually bad or are they playing
7523, squad spoken so um i have a quick one here that is very good,an embezzler so its probably fine,mind games

8209, this ones got 16 thrones but at the beginning theres 17 people,la that like the show tell em to get tickets and then, oh good

8245,someone else went up and went back aw man i cant imagine that,but why is empty room invoked there thats not sexy,its back in the woodshed
8246,now its been 20 minutes and im the only one left in the waiting room, hmm, formerly what
8247,except an old woman who is parked by the nurses door to yell at everyone, if someone said hey come have sex with me, okay
8248,who goes in before her you dont look sick do i go tell them that they,and i said yes i am interested and then they led me into, is that the name of the stop
8249,made a mistake what if theyre just busy how long do i wait before i, a room that was just ceiling and floor and then like four bare, is it colon formerly courthouse
8250,become the same as this old woman i live here now i suppose thats,walls, oh the name of the thing used to be courthouse and now its
8251,from darned in denver, theyre gonna dexter me, oh my god
8252, thats so hard because its really hard living in a society we can, were just hoping that people, holy shit
8253,all accept that its a common theme of our program but its especially, will put us on in the background to make love, i started playing pokemon go in the middle of that description it
8254,hard when it just it very clearly broke down on everyone, mmhmm just try to have sex while you laughs listen to my,was so fucking boring
8255, we can all agree that it broke down and i dont know how you get,brother my brother and me, laughing it used to be called courthouse
8256,out of that its hard to admit to another person in the machine like hey, cant do it just cant get the rhythm going yeah that is what, oh thats great oh man we need more shows named after the
8257,the machines broke and theres no recompense for that theres no way,most people dont know,buildings that theyre in
8258,out of it, yes, yeah now i dont think cbs gives a shit thats a pickup
8259, thats 100 percent what theres no doubt in my mind that is 100, impossible, youll be able to watch that on tv damn
8260,percent verbatim tone and everything they would sound like my brother, theyre always trying to come for us but no one else is coming for, what the fuck
8261,thats how sure i am that is the exact response you would get,us, sedition
8262, cause its the doctor right if the doctors like uh we just let, but wait, but its fun is it a drama is this still a drama or is this a
8263,anybody back there no matter what name we call whatever its all, isnt that movie already done,comedy
8264,bullshit like the next like what else are they making up right what, singing heres a song about fucking, i mean its a short show the fuckin full force of the military rolls
8265,else are they just like pulling out of their asses, laughs singing it takes a village to hold this gun,over em
8266, are they getting all your fungus medicine, laughs spoken weve done it by jove, yeah its like that
8267, what if theres none left for you, justins looking for the question list, its like under the dome but without the dome so the militarys
8268, laughs eating all your fungus medicine and smuggling it out in, i like the phrasing of that like this lamp makes me able to date,just like i guess well kill all of you then weird
8269,their bellies,my painting, i think they can fix this up i like some of the stuff in there
8270, im jim but im in a hurry im jim in a hurry, first of all i would like to address the first sentence and maybe, son of a
8271, thats true,its just i havent worked enough internships but i have never heard it been, oh my god why is travis so fucking good at this
8272, the hospital syd works at has killer bacon,said that any internship remains unpaid as long as you havent stolen, laughs um
8273, okay what is she doing,enough, yeah thats a oof wow thats a big pickup wow holy shit
8274, dont look sick youre not showin it, uh, okay all right eventually we gotta start getting back to our core
8275, you think that maybe she was a bad egg maybe for a little bit, heres a chill way,competencies
8276,when you originally thought about it wrong and you think that maybe she, ask your boss do you mind if i move this lamp, yeah
8277,was kind of a bad egg, yeah you leave that what now listen this is risky cause if, oh my god
8278, you cant just start talking about home alone,your boss says move it where, what thats a
8279, id love that griff,and you say my home the jig is up laughs, thats a pass
8280, woah, yes, that may have the problem is it was called nana
8281, for school, heres what ill say heres another way to ensure success here, okay
8282, yes,ask it like this and its cool if i take this lamp right, tv sucks
8283, yes travis, yes, was i mean did he crash did he crash or hit somebody
8284, i didnt even think that part was particularly complex or nuanced, and you dont even need you dont even need something to come,doesnt sound like it
8285, smell it yeah your teachers going to get that egg and be like,before the and but the implication is like, that wouldve been included
8286,oh thats fine you can put it in the trash good work keeping it not, weve had a whole conversation about the cool things that will, yeah
8287,cracked,happen when i leave and this is one, i just think that if he didnt crash or run into somebody he sure did
8288, unless, laughs you know what lets shorten it and just say eh,drive pretty safely i think and you have nothing to complain about you
8289, give me that stinky egg, yes yes youre the light in my life and this is now the light in,know what i mean
8290, i had to do it,my apartment, the nascar the nascar guys they drive freakin fast and they
8291, it proved that i was ready to be a father, maybe just say like i brought this lamp from home,spin around one big track and they bump into each other and its cool and
8292, it is not can i say that is the object of the lesson right its,and when your boss is like but its like all the other lamps,thats the only race that matters anymore because in horses if you bump
8293,hard to be a parent heres an egg to take care of can you imagine how,and you say thats why i brought it in cause it reminded me of all the,its ruined but they are safe about it you know what i mean
8294,hard this would be one of the two things is gonna happen,other lamps, this is safe
8295,one is the kids gonna do a pretty good job and be like im ready to be a, mmhmm, i
8296,dad im a very responsible 15 year old that egg looks beautiful im, uhhuh, laughs
8297,ready to be a dad, mmhmm, and then stop bragging about your son and his skills in the
8298,thats one option the other one is it like the other problem with this is, mmhmm,workplace
8299,it is nothing like that laughs its nothing like it, youll note by the way the key there will be when you dont have, we get it
8300, its nothing like it,the puppet if someone says hey wheres the puppet now you know, i just think if you dont get hurt or dead then the thing you did
8301, cant do it with them, now you know,was safe i have never broken a bone in my body or been killed and so
8302, to be fair the kid wouldnt explode but you probably shouldnt, why,everything ive ever done in my life including lying to a robber at gunpoint
8303,drop em, laughs,about gamestops playstation 3 inventory was really safe
8304, okay, mm, well
8305, cause babies can recover from a drop or two, mm, see thats a good show
8306, there is also the problem of like if you get really hungry while, no, laughs
8307,youre watching your child its probably not gonna occur to you to scarf it, yeah i would say the first floor is probably fine second third, thats good
8308, you probably wont think to scarf the child,and fourth its probably an issue but fifth you probably have enough, only one of them though right like we gotta set em apart so
8309, uh heres what i would do i would put it in vinegar overnight, maybe tie the lamp laughs use fishing line,theres the barrister wig one
8310,the shell will the acid of the vinegar is gonna brake down some of the, so that it they cant see it tie it to your belt buckle so it looks, theres the theres judge lance ito is just in it
8311,shell thats why we use vinegar when were helping to color eggs cause,like it hopping behind you and just you say like come on come on, he is one of them
8312,they break down some of the proteins of the shell so put it into vinegar,and theyll be like the lamp wanted to be with them laughs the lamp, mmhmm
8313,its gonna break down some of the shell and its gonna absorb some of that,chose them over us,
8314,vinegar smell and its gonna have a real gnarly stink on it like a real, okay,laughs come on
8315,rough stink, there it is, but we could be brothers
8316, if you have a stinky egg thats out of your control, mm,no judge thats not how it works
8317, yeah ask the chickens stinky ass why it makes its bad eggs, wha im so theres theres so many things there, shit
8318, yeah this is the chickens ass not mine its your nasty, thats true, objection get naked
8319,assignment devon, is that why its called the drawing room maybe its more like the, this is a very sexually aggressive boy band thats typically not
8320, please its mr peterson i will see you on fortnite later but,drawing together of new ideas or perhaps where you might draw cards for a,their style
8321,please it is mr peterson at school,game of bridge, i object to you not liking me

8331,neither my boss nor the person other person involved in the project works, im no uh historian but id be willing to bet that basically for as,account pretending to be the guy he fought and started sending him
8332,here anymore so no one else even knows they exists the chocolates,long as youve been dining in it i think the dining room has been called the,messages talking im assuming it says shit i tried bringing up the
8333,when unwrapped have a thin dusty whiteness to suggest they are past,dining room,fight every day at school tried spreading rumors about the other person
8334,their prime, eh,talking shit
8335, laughing i eat them occasionally should i stop and save them, yes, still and no matter what i do they wont fight again its
8336,for a future use that may never come thats from the cocoa monster in, yes,bullshit didnt bleep this one yahoo weird that i didnt get to see
8337,canada holy shit holy shit, thats the big one because i think if you called your living room,it in person i only got to see the video
8338, i mean i bet it has a bad taste of it the flavor to it i mean,the drawing room even your family who loves you the most they would, uh oh i like the book is better laughs pretentiously
8339, it seems like that part would be bad and it seems like i dont,be like hmm that was weird thats okay its fine and then you call, uh they missed the big fight and i only saw one fight and it was
8340,know what role the chocolate played in the presentation again a vital piece,the dining room the morning room theyre probably gonna say do you,in high school and somebody had to go to the to see the doctor who lives
8341,of context people you have to tell us these things we cant just guess,mean the dining room but the second you say scullery its done,in the hospital because of how bad it was and i didnt i wouldnt say that
8342,but i assume the chocolate was meant to be a positive right, its done,i love i liked it
8343, the chocolate the chocolate in the presentation is a net reward i, laughs, i wouldnt say that i wouldve been sad if i missed it or maybe
8344,would assume and not a negative, hmm,its good that i did see it because i was so viscerally horrified by the fight
8345, eat this old fuckin baseball card chocolate this foul chocolate, seems selfexplanatory did you look were there photos,that i have gone out of my way to live a life that is essentially fightfree
8346, i think it i think that unless someone tells this is for my life, mm, ohh
8347,unless someone specifically says to me dont throw this away i am trying, oh, we need to get them fightin again though for this one
8348,to throw shit away constantly all the time, ooh yeah, mmhmm

8350,i threw that shit away years ago what are you talking about thats, mm, yep
8351,nonsense that you think i would still have that no way, mmhmm, i think you gotta find what both of them like and then leave a trail
8352, can you give him a fun brand name, probably sex dungeon,of each thing leading each person to one spot and then hope that the fight
8353, guys bad news, i think you could get away with solarium only because people,will kind of just happen once they are with each other like if your friends

8502,and looked around to see at least six other winetasting tables scattered, im going to says its handbreaded including chee, im imagining going out of town and then our dad goes to stay at
8503,around the store yall each table had six wines available to sample and, its handbreaded with a mixture of cheetos dust,one of my friends houses here in austin and then after being there a couple
8504,everything else was free my question is what is the appropriate etiquette, and then maybe some kind of like cheesy sauce,days and just chilling and playing it cool he tells my friends i want you
8505,here what are we supposed to drink 42 wine samples or is there a more, yeah wholeass cheetos right there on top,guys to give me some feedback on my parkour and then he starts doing
8506,strategic and classy way to handle this offering thats from merlots of, cheetos blood,parkour all around the house

8508, uhhuh, and with each sandwich we put just a little bit of irony in every, yeah and this ones too hot for tv

8651,history to survive and somehow find a way home in a series called triangle, laughs,answer back
8652, i know you nasty boys would watch it it is in contention for midseason consideration, is it would it be the biggest salad or the most salad, yeah grandmas love ballers
8653, havent made a decision on this one yet but abc you pounce or, mmhmm, its definitely ballers laughs
8654,im gonna kickstart it for myself put it on youtube, yeah now you would have to not weigh like you couldnt have, yeah
8655, were gonna go over to cbs and cbs is where the old people play,a weight running during it right youd have to say like i think i will eat, um okay so just a quick update i am looking at a vulture recap of
8656,and thats where they like to get nasty and do their old stuff with none of,10 pounds of salad right and then you just start eating and then you,season one episode three of ballers which would be the inciting episode its
8657,the young people watching no cell phones allowed over at cbs thats,say and im done i think that was 10 pounds and make it about,called move the chains um and heres just a little excerpt from their recap
8658,what its called no cell phones allowed uh so were gonna get nasty over,guessing how close you can get to the weight that you said,thanks to this episode i practically see reggies whole arc mapped out for the
8659,there to find the most boring series available, oh wow,rest of the season while he claims to be looking out for his boy vernon even
8660,um tommy is the first one when a former highranking nypd officer, huh,telling spencer hes mostly pissed that he wasnt consulted about the ideas that
8661,played by edie falco becomes the first female chief of police for los angeles, oh i figure to say how many hot dogs do i think i can consume in,he had for his friend and his brand we later learn that thats all bullshit
8662,she uses her unflinching honesty and hardball tactics to navigate the social,10 minutes cause i think my strategy would be to tap out really early,and then more stuff more stuff more stuff next paragraph
8663,political and national security issues that converge with enforcing the law, well id just get heartburn,loudly but enough about reggie lets get to ricky smashing alonzos mom
8664, its tominy its called tommy but it was formally known as, and i have stuff to do on the 5th and stammering let me tell,so it seems like maybe its ballers
8665,nancy so laughing i guess they just decided to call her something,you, it could be ballers
8666,different on this one, in our show, because i think episode three is the episode if i clicks tongue if i
8667, are you its absolutely a pickup travis god your instincts are so, uhhuh,remember correctly let me go through my notes this is the one where ricky
8668,good of course edie falco, in 10 minutes,does smash alonzos mom

8676, laughing no its, laughs, laughs high pitched love scenes
8677, courthouse right okay it follows the dedicated chaotic, thats the thing so thats a ey if i was nathans you know, thats important i think that thats important right making sure
8678,hopeful and sometimes absurd lives of the judges assistant district,what the hot eating contest i would propose is watch somebody eat one,everybody feels comfortable i just am imagining somebody be like gravelly

8786,lingo kind of already, but not yet, this scenario getting the haircut it can be very uncomfortable which is
8787, thats a good see thats a better idea for a show, wait whered they come back from,why like for me i have had the same hairstylist now for a few years its like
8788, thats a good name for a boy band though too, donut holes,one of the longer streaks ive had with a hairstylist and it is largely she does a
8789, a judgethemed, a pokémon donut,great job cutting my hair but the reason i decided to stay is because i had found
8790, a judgethemed boy band with the wigs and what all, collect em all,comfort there
8791, theres i mean theres judge reinhold is like their manager for, uhhuh, i had found a routine that was comfortable its a huge selling point so i
8792,sure, yeah,dont think we i dont think this is this is not like a travesty right like this
8793, and judd nelsons there and hes like im never changing my, yeah,person closes their eyes when they get a haircut im sure that your hairstylist
8794,name ever i love you boys im never changing this name im never, yes,has seen weirder things because it is an inherently strange human flaw that
8795,adding the g no matter how many times you ask, and i think we can all agree no jellyfilled thats just gonna get,these weird sticky itchy things keep coming out of our heads and other parts of
8796, never,on your jncos,body that we wish they just would stop for like a minute so i could get a handle
8797, what if they had a song called i wanna supremely court you, ooh yeah yeah and there is bacon on it for certain,on it

8807, its not though, mm mmhmm, thats really great
8808, mm, yes ban em like pogs, i think giving the hairstylist an activity to do while theyre cutting as
8809, yeah you gotta sign kids to a threefight deal minimum, sure,we are suggesting universally here giving them something to occupy themselves
8810, you want the you wanna give em the chris evans package, thats so fucking cool,like a child on a road trip is definitely the right way to go so you can so you
8811, you want them to be fighting whenever and wherever you say for, man thats a cool donut i wish i could eat it,can just close your eyes and have a good anxiety nap

9155,time,and theyre like whos your manager,go through the border here and the border is um is just thomas edison
9156, that was what i imagined why else would you text text about the,and be like me im my own assistant manager,and he has his nuts up on a table and you get to step right on them
9157,episodes as we watch them, you know that happens a lot i because i have worked so many, you step right on them as you go in and everybody gets to do
9158, so wait a minute im just gonna get a bunch of fuck ill be middle of,retail jobs in my life i still have that retail stink that when i am just walking,one so thats would be one thing you get
9159,my day and my grandma is gonna be like aw man uh tell you what the rock,around any retail store no matter how i am dressed at least once i will be, thomas edison he might be listen were not here to kinkshame
9160,has really got these ballers around his finger huh anyway i cant believe he,asked do you work here no matter what im doing,anybody were as accepting as the next one but like thats a pretty
9161,went to this like im just gonna get random texts, but theres just something about me that gives off the vibe of like,intense thats a fun kink but you can only do it once it seems like
9162, no i dont know its just a guess it seems the right its it felt good in,this is someone who should work here it might be that there are lots of, yeah thats a good point thats a good point
9163,the moment,people who worked at best buy with me whose names i did not and will not, yeah uh yeah i dont think he would like that i think that
9164, you think it might be entourage,know,would probably be his hell
9165, it feels like its probably ballers, mmhmm, laughs ah shoot why did i do
9166, a show that may only exi i feel like ballers okay i feel this way about, it might also be my gait, ah beans
9167,a lot of entertainment programming but i feel this way definitely about ballers, i might have a retail gait, shoot ah man
9168,where its its like a fake, mmhmm, ah frick i just like i was walking to quiznos just kind of lost
9169, its like a facade, yes,my train of thought nah farts groans but then you get to stomp on
9170, and if i walked in through the front like on a sound stage if i walk in, that is a thats an employee who knows his way around a crate,tommy eds balls and thats pretty righteous for me
9171,through the front door of ballers it would just be two by four supports and paint, look at those hands those are crate hands and they would be, shoot man id want that to be im not a fan of the gentleman i
9172,paint cloths and and and and everything like theres not actual show in there,right,would like that waiting for me at the pearly gates
9173,like youre not actually like they only shoot enough to do like the montage of, i have heard that they are good companion books, so every week
9174,please dont cancel your hbo because game of thrones ended we got lots of, yes, you get a little bulletin slid under your door every week and it lets
9175,other things, that is true the books do share a lot of similar words,you know a schedule of whos gonna be there for ball step and then also
9176, and its a real show, laughs,like you gotta be separated into teams so like im on the indigo team
9177, okay, please close the door behind you on your way out,travis and justin youre both on the blue team so you get to like share the
9178, so it could be ballers could you email just text your grandma about, laughs, no theyre gonna cycle people in and out yeah
9179,the artistry, yeah, most of them are inventors yeah like the guy who made guns
9180, right im really believing this this is appropriate i love the lighting, only you know where the door is its like the wardrobe in lion the,his nuts are donezo
9181,you know like that kind of that kind of thing,witch and the wardrobe it might not work the same again you know, uh the devil the devil gonna come up there cause boy his
9182, this feels so intimate yeah,maybe youll end up on joe rogans show joe rogans mr tumnus in this,works are pretty naughty i think so let me get on those nuts
9183, how do you think im feeding my family podcasts come on,scenario, thats why the f
9184, laughs yeah its, hes a very tumnusesque figure as hes been described numerous, um yeah i mean thats one rude option i mean semisonic
9185, the reason the reason griffin had a hard time believing that intimacy,times,didnt do all this work for you not to play their song for people
9186,coordinator is a real thing is because rob schneider did not make a movie where, woah, for this exact scenario this exact sitenuation
9187,he stars as a, laughs, yeah
9188, right i mean because of the absence of a rob schneider movie like, aw man do i got a dry soda hole, its a great track semisonic its one of semisonics best id
9189,the pork doctor or whatever the fuck laughs hed call it, if only there was some way i could moisten my soda hole,argue
9190, the s i mean it would be the sexpert which is unfortunate because, hmm,i think you need to bump into them to make the drink spill cause that
9191,that d be our brand, mmhmm,works for me most of the time and youre laying on the floor now so thats
9192, being drug through the mud but thats why wheezes he had a hard, gasps,gonna be a tricky situation you are gonna have to get up and walk directly
9193,time believing it because its not a rob schneider movie already, is that rude,over to where they are probably on the couch and wow bumping into
9194, yeah id love that grif thank you thank you, hmm,somebody while theyre sitting on a couch is gonna be pretty tough im not
9195, snorts, well justin i think the implication there is that she was,gonna lie to you
9196, laughs quietly,encouraging her dogs to eat the questionaskers cat alfstyle,uh maybe an earthquake can you simulate an earthquake or say you
9197, laughs, will the cat eat the mouse for sure,have vertigo and just sort of spill right into their four lokos or whatever
9198, sometimes the tv talks, and i believe in the circle of life something has to eat the cat and,call em an uber maybe but thats expensive hmm
9199, it could be the tv we dont know for sure,it might not be the dog but i think the dogs just the next size up and it, no i dont think you want to be mean turn on some tv show that
9200, yeah this is true,would be weird if if it would be weird if in like cartoon shorthand,youre watching right now to the episode that youre watching right
9201, ehh,everyone understood like well yes cats eat mice and horses eat cats, oh my god yeah somebody turns it on and theyre like what
9202, this parts this parts dirty,like that would be weird there has to be some steps between there little,are you watching

9386,comic pages is apropos to do a whole restaurant about it, the poor man was left strapped in the chair and not able to move, dr light its mega man x 6
9387,garfieldeats is a new food experience brought to you by the worlds first, obviously, the boner but people shorthand online communities will call it
9388,entergaging app, no its just that its so why else would it be 88 hours,the boner one

9392,release, laughs,and thisll be like my own seasoning sort of like old bay just like a new sort
9393,its the worlds first entergaging app and it is an entertaining and engaging, it would be hold on maybe this is how that worked because,of blend and when you put it on food it makes it taste just like rancid shit
9394,app,they didnt have the internet back then so maybe people like went to like,and then you can use you can cook you say hey i got this new air
9395, fuck,da vinci and said hey,fryer you cook it for your roommates but you do season it with griffins
9396, off, can you paint me some boobs,special stuff

9398,its an entertaining and engaging app that replaces the quick service restaurant, how well do you know this person at this you probably know this,and youre like hmm i guess the air fryer sucks and then they wont
9399,with the quick mobile restaurant okay,model better than most of your own family,want to use it because of the bad taste i put on it with my powder
9400, not a qsr a qmr the app immerses the user in a complete garfield, and ive run out of wall space, and then another use is for for griffins rancid shit powder is
9401,experience, its a flipbook and it just becomes me at the end,like uh prank against a school bully

9406,costume and maybe a giant house that makes me feel like the perspective of a, we in fact just spent the whole time discussing the premise,synthetic chemical i would not make people eat poop as a joke cause
9407,tiny kitty maybe even a box of dirt im supposed to shit in, they get increasingly more expensive,thats a crime but i would
9408, yeah unless i can experience this app through the oculus rift i dont, okay, no no its not poop its not poop but the principal oh my

11132,like losing it with this great prop comedy you did that they wont even, yeah but it was worth it to get sticky off of it,time dilation
11133,think like hell theyll assume that youll bring it back, yeah theres not sticky on anything anymore, from standing because youre further away from the planet or
11134, that will be the assumption thats made is that youll be bringing it, fuck,something
11135,back at your earliest convenience, this is some serious sticky, well do that next time
11136, if youre on the first floor this isnt great, well now, yeah yeah

11351, laughs good news the people eating this can only loosely be, why would i want that,you add em up that outranks the manager
11352,described as human so next complaint, theres also nothing there is no correlation in beer pong that, the old manager forged a recursive power loop that i exploited
11353, travis,relates to any kind of big anything element like what is the johnson,and now have become uns i am galactus now so
11354, no,supposed to represent there, laughs

11357, its just a fuckin theyre not gonna sell it im only interested in, laughs thats pretty good, a body a carriage that just seems to and maybe its traviss
11358,things that they thing that you a human would consume with your would, laughs but,broad shoulders or thick hands
11359,want to consume with your body um so yes that also happened its, did they ever have like an ouroboros big johnson shirt that was, its his gait

11364,quickly grab lunch between panels i was moderating the line at the food, laughing, and you are an employee here

11422, what if there was a single train track that wound its way through,someones money theyre insured they get the money back victimless, lost the roadmap here
11423,this great land we called america and there are food train stops wherever, well im saying if someone sent me a surprise like a surprise, yeah

11425,one train track,before it ever gets to me someone confiscates it takes it steals it but i,longer have a pet but i have i have had this situation not this exact
11426,and then when you started to get a line you have like a single car right,didnt even know i was gonna get the hundred dollars did they really steal,situation but like in the waiting room of the vet is theres some weird
11427,and people are lining up there at the carnival cause its in town for the,it from me im at the exact same place i was before and i didnt even,etiquette that i dont necessarily know

11430,so you if the line gets to be more than two people in line another car on,who is holding a hundred dollar bill dreaming of the things they will buy, yeah and so thats just the truth and thats the truth of the
11431,the food train comes and joins that one and all of a sudden you got twice,with it and how its gonna change their life and then you pull it out of their,matter but like if you sit down next to me and you got a little pupper dog
11432,as many windows no one is waiting if those people dissipate the food,hands and you run away with it i think thats worse,and the pupper dog wants to interface with one of your pets i dont know

11880,eat the coconut that you leave them,documentation shows,like stitch fix for instance its really good stuff they sell ya clothes
11881, end of story, laughing oh okay well uh then you get an a,well first they send you the clothes they send you the clothes in a box
11882, what why, and i wouldyes i would argue that theres a block party taboo,the selling comes after because you try on all this stuff a personal stylist is
11883, do you guys wanna know the red flags of owning a hermit crab,you do know about because you are writing us for permission to steal this,gonna like pick out stuff thats gonna look really good on your fuckin bod
11884,the things that really should make you sit up and call your veterinarian and,hummus,and youre gonna slap it on there and if you agree with the stylists fashion
11885,say hey i got a real hermit crab emergency, okay but heres the thing you guys,choices then you can keep it and you pay for it and then anything you
11886, the first one is lethargy laughs, this is really good hummus,dont want you ship on back for free
11887, you know this hermit crab used to have a lot of getupandgo, what if it is life changing hummus this isyouve neverlike you,there is a 20 styling fee but check this it goes right towards anything you
11888, the second one,thought you had lived before this moment but then you had this hummus,keep from your box and if you keep everything from your box when you go
11889, the second one is abandons shell and doesnt return which,and you cannot be without it,to stitchfixcommybrother youll get 25 off if you keep all the items in
11890,yeah, laughs,the box
11891, i would think that that would be a huge red flag since that they, thisll be better for everyone,and uh ive i am a stitch fix user myself and more often than not i do
11892,dont even have an ass as far as i know and theyre just gonna, laughs ohh,exactly that because theyve really theyve really got me dialed in they

12381, this is my thing you should be able to open the bottom of the bus, im travis mcelroy, laughs
12382,with a switch, im travis mcelroy your middlest brother, gonna tell you about blue apron now so here it comes
12383, and you just do it on the road, yeah, this is the cooking box its gonna have lots of stuff in it and
12384, laughs yeah right speed pushes the h button and i take a hot, no this isso uh im gonna say the broad scope of the intro is,youre gonna be confused by it why did i just get a big thing of asparagus
12385,shit,we can give some uh cooking advice cause this is an advice show where,and meat dont freak out look at the box it says blue apron on it
12386, right right on the road,we give advice and i would say the three of us are grown adults who often,thats how you know that the payload has been delivered
12387, laughs then it got into this okay then travis and i had this,do cooking and we may give cooking advice but the thing that directly, its not a threat
12388,this debate you could laughs travis was making the case that you could,inspired this is shortly before we began recording i discovered that uh dry, it is a box that gives you that those ingredients exclusively
12389,shit in the toilet and i said yes i could shit out here i could shit lots of,aged beef is just old meat just old meat,laughs meat and asparagus only
12390,places, uhhuh, and itll teach you how to use them in all different kinds of ways
12391, the moment someone says you cant, i want to talk about old beef, yeah
12392, griffin said he always goes at 9 oclock which was a half hour after, i want to talk about old beef here when you go into a fancy, theres a fucking golf ball in here what the
12393,we got on the bus,restaurant and they say  this is like six week dry aged beef you think, yeah
12394, twoandahalf hours later we stopped at yall know on the, ooh fancy shmancy but that just means like we put this beef in the, yeah
12395,border of indiana the arbys thats also a love truck stop,refrigerator and we forgot about it for a month and a half and now were, yeah
12396, we stop there and i s and griffin went into the bathroom and,charging you 30 extra to eat it, yeah yeah its confusing so anyway they make cooking a
12397,came out and i was like i gave him a thumbs up like mission, right were you tempted to punch it like rocky,sustainable part of your weekly routine and all their meals are carefully
12398,accomplished, griffin do you have thoughts about old beef,designed and tested by the test kitchen chefs boy i bet thats a good job
12399,he said no i couldnt cause my bodys apparently a grandfather clock, im just saying its old beef we like to call it dryaged thats what,snacking around on these good burgers and stuff
12400,where if i miss my opening i have to wait til tomorrow apparently,im saying  if i said heres some dryaged milk,they use unique specialty ingredients to bring chefquality recipes to your
12401, way too long, what if i said dryaged milk griffin,dinner table weve all used it i learned how to cook from it its really
12402, our advice to begin with is go before you get on the bus, i would like some dryaged chicken this is some dryaged fish,its the jam its the shit
12403, uh but i we do have questions,  lets talk about the dove, anyway if you wanna start making delicious bragworthy meals at
12404, it sucks that you cant shit on the bus but you can shit here on the, well okay the mistake i made is its if a magician,home without the hassle of
12405,stage, yes if a magician um decided that their act was going to be, yeah i mean
12406, griffin every syllable you say prolongs riddle me piss,heavily dependent on audience interaction so its like if the magician said, they look badass you can check out this weeks menu and get
12407, he was trying to break the record for longest continuous radio, see this dove what are you gonna do with it,60 off when you visit blueaproncommybrother thats
12408,broadcast, cause i didnt so much have a prestige in mind when i thought,blueaproncommybrother blue apron a better way to cook
12409, i knew a guy in college that tried to do that for 88 hours which is,about old beef,funky music plays
12410,why,  hey you take thisits your dove now you have to pay for dove, huzzah
12411, i thought this was my slumdog millionaire moment where that,food, huzzah
12412, obscure knowledge would pay off in a huge huge way, you guys dont want to talk about old beef, oh my god
12413, i think so, well i mean we could talk about sous viding but thats just wet, are you asking us
12414, but why,beef, um
12415, is this a true story like did this happen and theyre relating this, yeah but yknow sometime somewhere in there we can find we, mmkay
12416,tale,often find the funny in things that others might call mundane and we make, think outside the bun: purchase local
12417, anyway i groans,them fundane, hmm
12418, uh luckily we have actual advice questions to ask, well listen i cant always do all the work justin sometimes i, yeah
12419, im an art education major at indiana state university i had to,need you and griffin to help pick up the slack, yeah
12420,take a drawing class mainly one that focuses on the human form, well ihey i planted the seed and i need you to water it and, all right
12421, our class could only,sunshine down on it, they have one of those
12422, our class could only get one model and so we had to draw the, yeah thats more than some people do i expected you my older, what is this accent
12423,same guy twice a week for the entire semester i have drawn this guy 86,brother who has always been there for me to then go buy the seeds and, wait hold on
12424,times and laughs left them just lying around my room theyre all huge,then help me grow the wheat and then help me bake the bread, laughs
12425,pieces, yeah i threw you off expecting you to fly baby bird and you were, do you guys know what uh i think its pronounced halocline is
12426, like four feet tall as a lesbian with no interest in men,too afraid to spread your wings and talk about old beef, this is when uh usually like an underwater cave like really salty
12427,audience laughs, why are youhey why are you so scared griffin i was ready to,saltwater and freshwater like refuse to mix and so it creates like a visible
12428, what should i do with them i dont want to throw them out,take the leap by which i mean push you,surface from one water to the other
12429,there goes my obvious one thats from abby abby are you here, well i guess the difference is i jumped too but i knew there was, that you can see and im wondering if theres one of these at
12430,inaudible,no cord yknow what i mean like i think i told you  dont look but,the front door of the taco bell hotel because of how many farts like
12431, hi,theres a cord,concentrated
12432, hi, what is thatbut what is that a metaphor for in this scenario, condensed like fart air is in there that you literally can see like
12433,okay so, that is a cool stunt,a visible air surface
12434, my thing abby the one thing i do have to say first off is lets, travis pastrana, laughs
12435,invert this scenario i lets say i took a life drawing class where i drew the, old beef, mm
12436,same uh woman 48 times and then when people or 86 times excuse me, cold open more like cold cuts, mm
12437,and then people came over i have to be like now listen i love babes, then its a deep cut instead of a cold cut,and ladies and gentlemen coming back to the stage for the fourth time
12438,and these pics get me red hot, i feel like this mightveisnt this stuff that people used to do like,today eddie money
12439, thats not actually how art works laughs,i could see like an 18th century yknow dandy popping open some kind of, eddies back hey whats up yeah they asked me to do it
12440, we dont actually laughs we dont really keep pictures just,like yknow uh furlined case and yknow drawing out their favorite gilded,again uh and i said
12441,cause they rev their interests,fork, i said do you got any more crunchwraps and they laughed
12442, these 86 pictures that i did get me real real hot, that definitely seems like something,and laughed anyway singing ive got two tickets to paradise
12443, i kept em all, well yes, mmhmm
12444, if, yes, yeah
12445, yeah but if abby was straight and she told people that came over, yes much like awhen you microwave a breaded product you, yeah
12446,i cant throw em away they make me extremely horny,have about 30 seconds to use the thing before it goes completely bad, let me remind you youre going to have to sleep here

13182,taco bell,now part two, wow really
13183, yeah no i mean we might have mentioned it but we didnt have, your daughterso your daughter has created a stephen kingesque banana who has written himself into the narrative, okay
13184,all these fucking spicy details trav the bell, you should be sitting quietly and patiently for the show to start, yeah  yeah im you from the past duh this is gemini man
13185, a taco bell hotel and resort opening in palm springs in august its,just staring blankly ahead at the stage picturing what it will look like when,now day one by the way um yeah you gotta just i think mm dang
13186,a limited time experience but as this press release certainly reminds me all,our three bodies are up there,though juice you can say that i dont think any of us on the call would do
13187,things are limited time and this is a great application of the time that you, thats what i was looking at,that ive met a few mcelroys in my lifetime and ive never really buzzed
13188,have on earth is to go to the taco bell hotel which is called the bell, laughs,one up to find out if were blood
13189,available for a limited time, oh so true mm uh the, okay its possible this person did not meet them right they go
13190,uh what is gonna make the bell such a plea such an incredible, edgy now i would say that the answer is obvious,into a golf course and theres a man who comes in on monday nights for
13191,experience is that what i hear you asking what are your top questions, and that is unfinished business and that is that cavemen have,leagues there could be lots of people coming in for this thing right its not
13192,about the bell,pretty simple business to finish,like they are playing golf together explicitly
13193, it was it was kind of rhetorical but i was also curious, right like i wanted to sneak up on that big animal oh no the big, pause what are you saying
13194, the food obviously yes thank you the food yes heres,animal killed me oh now im a ghost i can sneak up on that big animal, okay youre right they do sell silly pants gosh you have golfed
13195,whats gonna be the b the be its taco bell laughs and and theres, go back to sleep,thats the
13196,also an unexpected take on a resort poolside menu i guess unexpected, and also theyve had the longest to complete their unfinished, thats the thoughts of a golfer there
13197,when youre staying at the taco bell hotel means not taco bell so,business, interesting
13198,theres the two things you can do there taco bell and not taco bell, theyve had a lot more people to help them now when you get to, sorry i just did the exact thing that you said i shouldnt do
13199,so youre looking at maybe um a toasted cheddar club with handbreaded,victorians very complicated business, laughs
13200,crispy chicken jalapeno bacon avocado sharp cheddar doesnt matter or, they had so much business to finish some of them were still trying, laughs
13201,an avocado toastada,to invent something that doesnt exist yet right theyre like  ahh im still, i dont give a fuck to any
13202, served on local multigrain toast with avocado breakfast radish,trying to figure out that jetpack ahh, lets see if its availjuice i think its available
13203,so this press release is bold enough to imagine a world where i would be the, yes that soldiers and old ladies have the most difficult business, uh im not gonna put any of my doppelgangers uh im not going
13204,sort of person that would go to the taco bell hotel and then say uh excuse, everybody knows that,to promote them they dont deserve what would happen after that i feel
13205,me is this bread local, yeah,like visàvis our listeners
13206, excuse me is this local multigrain toast from the region, laughs thats why you left twitter oh the barrage of cavemen, yeah
13207, yes,tweets but you also cant get away from the siren song of talking about, um we could do a yahoo
13208, um so theres gonna be a uh baja blast birthday freeze,cavemen, yeah another question would be better
13209, cause its celebrating the 15th anniversary and its gonna be, so its gronk and sylvia, well no cause people are doing this number neighbor shit thats
13210,served in the firstever freeze lounge to keep things chill, so becoming a ghost is an evolved trait of survival laughs,on good folks you gotta know not to do it
13211, so i guess this is a very cold lounge perfect for enjoying uh the, thats true, its where you like text one number higher than your phone
13212,baja blast i would argue we already have those and theyre called, i do think about not a lot of animal ghosts we dont get a lot of,number and youre like  whats up number neighbor and if i got that i
13213,morgues,like i saw yknow a bird ghost that doesnt happen its always human,would just assume theres somebody like outside of my house ready to
13214, but there will be an onsite morgue perfect,ghosts,murder me
13215, for enjoying a baja blast heres a quote i got a quote, well uh the first thing i would point out which griffin is now, like i would just assume that that is so like dont do that shit
13216, its from rene pisciotti hes the executive chef of the bell,demonstrating in a thermos you could be drinking anything,folks
13217, french accent lets be honest lets be honest food is the best, and if im not incorrect also laws will still apply while you consume, oh yes
13218,part of traveling a lot of effort and homework goes into finding out the best,them,  oh he farted to death oh shoot
13219,places to eat where you are staying, so even if you are caught ohh,  yeah he farted on an airplane and exploded
13220, this rene pisciotti but with the bell weve thought of everything,  are we gonna get in trouble for this is that gonna trace back to, listen you know which one you are and huff my shorts you did
13221,for you do you mean taco bell food laughs,us,my daddy bad
13222,from welcome beverages to room service to buildyourown breakfast, not that she drinks underage, laughs
13223,tacos and surprises throughout, what, nobody debases themselves to the point of doing a jack sparrow
13224, susprises without, also if you were consuming a claws at the time you could just,impersonation unless there isthey have some serious skin in the game
13225,uh many of which feature local ingredients like our horchatadate,steal the shirt, unintelligible jack sparrow gibberish i just made myself an idiot
13226,smoothie were curating the ultimate taco bell food experience so the, i would alquestion asker i would point out that if you went out to,on the internet for that and i did it for money for this job that we do here
13227,bell is a hotel that has the bravery to look laughs at the taco bell menu,a restaurant for lunch with some coworkers and had like a beer it might, impersonating jason statham ey its me jack sparrow get in
13228,and say well certainly not this,not be great but youre not gonna like get fired for that right now,the fuckin car man
13229, certainly you didnt intend on consuming this,admittedly doing it in the office does change a lot of factors there, clapping you fucked up
13230, no, but i think its totally cool and chill, in the most delectable way
13231, its local farts, laughing  no you should say very good, you need to be honest with yourself right now and you need to
13232, the fun the fun you ask well theyve got the fun while d, no not today owner of restaurant i wont say it,think about do you spend literally all day around this very small office like
13233,daytime djs play jams basically someones nephew hooked up spotify, you could say it like this  how was it, mm giggity and your boss is like  oh i got a way to put that behavior

13242,i want to go to this place with a desire that im not sure i can quantify, that is true though also if youre like publicizing a writing,themselves for five minutes while they imagine what this fucking voicemail
13243, with the sort of linguistic tools that we trade in on this show we,yknow the menu for the restaurant or whatever you cant just say like,would sound like you could envision any business any business fuckin
13244,very rarely get into sort of uh poetry or or epic narrative at all and i feel, we have some lasagna,lasik a lasik surgery center and imagine what these muppets rolling all
13245,like thats what i would need to sort of communicate that desire with which i, laughs  do you want our lasagna its edible,over it and jack and some of the family guy folks coming in and like

13823, i know,than take apart some kind of double quarter pounder and say like  now you, nudge it in
13824, buy it before cincinnati can get their grubby mitts on it,get this part of a bun and this one patty thats nothing, same

15489, its hobbs and shaw no its,leg around real fast,actualuh its an actual business
15490, the search for the secret formula which i was stoked about but, uh sure it wasi didnt have anything in mind it was just like,and theres one here in austin we really like and we take henry to when
15491,my wife as children rended her flesh apart informed me that we would not,an openended prompt,hes got a little too much yknow kid juice and we need to just wring it out

15493, theres one person left and theyre like  anyway its blended up,one at a time now we got something,theres one chamber in this area that has a little uh like air cannon that
15494,raisins,audience laughs,shoots upwards and you put these little foam balls into it and it like gets
15495, i there was a we couldnt do most of the things cause the kids, but do move bothboth knees at the same time,sucked out the air cannon and it shoots up and you can throw a bunch in
15496,didnt give a crystal shit about any of this, dont do it right now as were workshopping it because we didnt,and it creates a big fun foam ball confetti and thats really great
15497, they did not give one solitary dookie,have you sign a liability,surrounding this little vacuum launcher into the air are four cannons that
15498, yeah well fantas upstairs man thats a coke product baby, yeah,you put balls in and then you step on a switch and it fires them at high
15499, thats what im saying its a big thing they dont care so were, dont lie,speed out of the tip of the cannon and you can move them and aim them
15500,skipping most of it i did notice however there is a very long line of people, could you have a romantic dance battle,and do whatever you want with them
15501,waiting to get into the vault where the only handwritten recipe for cocacola is i know what youre saying  i cant wait to lays on it well no you,audience laughs,that design seems awful yes
15502,dont look at it its a line to go into the vault where they keep the recipe, whenever that happens to me and i find myself on thethe outside, i bring my twoyearold into the fun ball zone and then there is
15503,all i can tell you was everybody in this line has now been planted a seed,of a dance circle the circumference of a dance circle im like mentally,alast time we went there there were a couple of i would say eightyearolds and im not gonna slam eightyearolds but they were indoorbased
15504,where they are going to go home and tell some unsuspecting person the,preparing for the moment where somebody kind of gestures towards me and,life forms and one of them shot me right in the fucking face
15505,most boring story theyve ever heard,i can go, got me right in theand i didnt see it coming like iihe got
15506, laughs thats true, no,me right in the cheek not even in my periphery i didnt see it coming i
15507, i have bad news after tasting all the worlds sodas and this is, how about you,was blasted in the face by one of these small boys and then i was like

15509,country on earth, my first dance with my wife for our weddingwe got maybe 45,thinking about ruined my trip
15510, i know i know it was hard for me to realize too but after i tasted,seconds in and then i realized like this songs like four and a half,if one of these indoor boys blasts my twoyearold with one of these
15511,this soda thats about pineapples what am i supposed to do,minutes long,cannons what do you do
15512, youve had the beverly its like campari that doesnt fuck you up, and i think then i said other people can dance too, im asking it

15514, its a very bitter unpleasant trying soda, obligatory borat impression my wife,schoolers
15515, yeah it tastes like a, with room for the holy ghost,  and he goes to jail forever i dont wanna end up like that
15516, it tastes like the back of a switch cartridge its miserable, now if you want to do a romantic dance battle thats basically,so what do you do cause i just kind of tried to put my body around

15583, okay laughing, ooh,that cinderella will turn me away
15584, thats what we almost had you do by making you come up on stage, man thats deep,what is that next to the sprite slide a water slide
15585,and demonstrate but no you will not have to do this thing youve picked a, um this is a very real question that is bothering me immensely, for a small
15586,skill that while great for you and very healthy and,how long does a juggling party last, sprite brings yousprite presents the sprite slide a sprite
15587, good for your heart and boring to watch youve picked a skill that,audience laughs,experience
15588,is not applicable in the real world the only time i have jumped rope is that, no that is the wronghey no, and you go down that and youre like sprite that was fun
15589,theres a game at chuck e cheese where you have to pretend to jump a, okay thats different though right that is not likeif you went,and theyre like i know
15590,rope,to a juggling party and say theres eight people there which is a good get,and youre like it wentit went flat months ago
15591,now you can see that game at chuck e cheese with your coworkers and,for a juggling party id say and you start juggling and you all hit a rhythm,and theyll be like yeah its sprite
15592,engineer a scenario where youre like  hold on let me try this out but,and then its just like alright so weve all demonstrated we can do this do, its sprite
15593,you know and i know that youre gonna get caught on the second fuckin,you wanna i dont know through laughter watch a movie now, its sprite it went flat four minutes after we poured it but um
15594,one and youre gonna look like a clown, youre being fishcatted, so yeah you gottayoure pretty sticky huh oh cinderellas
15595, youre gonna look like a clown that bragged about being great at, clownfished,not gonna like that well for 40 sprite presents water slide
15596,jump rope that gets caught up by the chuck e cheese jump rope machine, heres what i dont, laughs
15597,instantly, yes, sighs
15598, chucks gonna say it, uh i dont think you need to learn to juggle because i am not a, right
15599, yeah,juggler but i am a performer uh and, you will get sprite
15600, they can jump rope for approximately eight seconds before youre, somebody kind of snorted at that alright, at the end
15601,like  i hope they fuck up,audience laughs, groans yeah
15602,  id love to stop watching this, no its alright i like your sparkly shirt,i mean if im being honest
15603, yes, were cool but i am a performer and what i like way more than a, this is kind of what i thought the world of coke museum was
15604, yeah i dont want to be too dismissive this isnt juggling after all,fellow performer is an audience,gonna be like
15605,this is a real skill, so what you have to offer to be at the juggling party is just going, im not saying i expected gene wilder to roll up there in a big
15606, itsno its nowhere near juggling,good juggling everyone,brown hat and do his songs and his dancings teaching me about the history
15607, now were talking about nothing thats nonsense what are you, cause if everyones juggling no ones paying attention,and also danger of coke production
15608,stop what are you juggling, yes, alright yeah bud you got it
15609, whoaaa, ii actually would argue its not worse cause with comedy its so, much like naruto iinin japan in hakone there is a hot spring
15610, youre weaving at this point,subjective where with juggling through laughter its pretty binary,water park called yunessun that we went to it was tight as hell they had a
15611, yes please, or like i didnt wanna eat that apple i guess this is okay,hot spring water slide that was fun relaxing fresh they had a yogurt bath
15612, when i have anyone do a job for me that i am incapable of doing, huh,they had a wine bath they had like a green tea bath and it was sothe
15613,myself which is to say most jobs i work extremely hard to never look at, i feel like theres a step in the middle zack,whole time i was there i was like  i have only been submerged in water i
15614,them and its not because i think im superior  in fact quite the opposite, that youre not sharing which is and ive said no,have only been submerged in water you would think there would be at least

15675,  by the time i figured this out the face painting folks set up next to, its funny you should say that cause right after i said he sings the,only eyes
15676,me so i couldnt move all i could think to do was angle my body away from,song about summer glau i realized how inappropriate it was that the song, laughs
15677,them eat as fast as possible and pretend that nothing was happening was,was like how happy ill be in summer, you have pride
15678,there anything else i couldve done thats from top noping in, and then you like you were reading my mind said im gonna, laughing
15679,chattanooga is that a rock climbing thing top nope,take a little bit of heat off of travis no pun intended and make it even, she says badass
15680, the bad side of that is statistically speaking youre the only human,more inappropriate, laughing
15681,being to ever encounter it, huh, i think yeah
15682, chicken on a stick, that is i guess inappropriate in a different way in that this is a, yeah
15683, thats good protein,comedy show and so that was probably an inappropriate thing to say for, well and also they kill us with cheezit food they killthey kill

15687,  umm about 2:30am is that, oh im reading here this is a new one on smoking gun it was just, laughs right
15688,  good for start time and then its just kind of to question,released they address the fact that in this one you find out that the only, uh how about our second question of the episode 46 minutes in
15689,mark,way elsa was able to bring snowlaf to life was she had to steal a soul from, laughs
15690,  its important to note theyll be sweating it off every 15 minutes,someone in town, i think its probably jazz but i like jozz also
15691, laughs, so thats addressed itsall of his memories start flooding back, uh alright as long as were talking about ai lets get into it
15692, i feel like the rock climbing gym should be included with the rave, and olaf has to deal with like you know he finds his family but, i think its good habits to get into
15693,price im already here i might as well climb i wish you could have a rave,like his human family, i think its a good habit to get into because it helps you be nice
15694,at the aggro crag,  and they uh they dont want him back,like it helps you sort of just stay onbecause you should say please and
15695, guts but its a rave for adults, what,thank you to folks its nice its good to be polite politeness is good travis
15696, dddo you have it drugs, i thought you might say something like michael keaton or,has a whole fuckin podcast about it

16917, hand to god, i mean dirt is just small rock right,minister to come around and pray so that it goes into the light

17068, you just need to find an obtuse way of answering like is the chili,comes over youve got a cauldron for one embarrassing no thank you a,  and how many times you smelled like this then back then
17069,good and you say  oh i love chili,big cauldron you can make one portion a small cauldron you cant make, yes

17080, yeah griffin,cause thats the thing  if a villager rolled up and said like yknow  i need, right
17081, emily does that help,a potion to punish my enemies you wouldnt be like  okay sit down this, now clears throat

17354, laughing, sleazy unprofessional work relationships old men and young,a lot and so any bullshit you talk about backstage you are spending
17355,  would it be weird if i put croutons in a chip bowl for company to,women very bizarre fake sex on a movie set this movie does not age,precious amounts of your budget and what did justin open up with as soon
17356,snack on during events such as football parties and holidays they do not,well,as we got here to the venue well im glad you asked
17357,seem that different from cheetos and every time i make a salad i find, justin guess, if he seems to taper off towards the end of the show or becomes
17358,myself crunching on them by themselves am i alone in my desire for them, its love actually,completely inaudible because his voice has completely given up the ghost
17359,to be treated as a standalone snack or is everybody thinking the same,audience cheers,rest assured it was worth it because he talked to us about gallagher for
17360,thing but theyre too afraid to start the trend thats from sneaky salad, laughs yuck,like 15 20 minutes
17361,snacker steven in silverdale,now i have notoh no we wore out the first interpreter, words budget
17362, dont fucking waste your time with croutons that you buy at the, was it all the yelling laughs, three minutes is so much money that they paid for
17363,store here is how we, the hand movements had to be bigger, laughs
17364, fucking mix upyoure gonna melt some fuckin butter youre, now ive never seen love actually how close did i approximate, laughs
17365,gonna put it over stale bread some seasoning salt garlic salt whatever,it, yes some watermelon husk sticking out of her brain still justins
17366,and then bake it up in the oven and youre gonna have a treat that your, yeah,fucking crying
17367,guestsit wont even matter nomenclature will be behind you it is butter, we all do time passes, thats why he does it thats whathe creates a protective field of
17368,toasted bread with seasoning on it it will be the absolute hit of the entire, my one defining feature is laughs i consume a lot of ravioli,fruit caltrops to slip up hishis potential assailants
17369,affair,anyways through laughter i have some health concerns, yes
17370,also what you could do if you love the crouton flavor but youre worried, no no heres what i will say cause i edited this question down, were nearing four minutes now
17371,about the sort of uh whole concept of the thing make em slightly bigger,for time but there was a line in it where they said that there was a, whoa
17372,yknow like two croutons sized and then have a nice dip maybe a nice dip,restaurant in the town of the summer camp that had an allyoucaneat, laughs
17373,not a creamy dip something palatable,ravioli night, in second person
17374, just a nice little dip yeah, which in and of itself seems like it should be shut down holding, laughs
17375, why didnobodys bringing up creamy dip here,back laughter by the cdc, its wild
17376, now heres the thing you shouldnt do this, no, this is an abuse of power
17377, you could but we have to keep croutoneverybody only wants to, it actually seems like you could set up a weird drinkingstyle game, this is likethis is like  dont worry ill cover your shift as an
17378,eat croutons,but ravioli game where you set up a chessboard with different ravioli,emt but first im taking this injured person to taco bell
17379, this is no,squares and if you land on one the other person has to eat it and they, broken people
17380, everybody only wants to eat croutons but we have to keep,die, theres probably more thanokay
17381,croutons in the salad to have a reason to eat the salad, thank you, laughs
17382, there is no reason to eat the salad, wait,  too puzzling
17383, thats right if we just ate those then the next time you eat a, oh, waiting outside the riddlescom window for them to turn on the
17384,salad youd be like  well this is not as good as the one salad i had that, at the crown,fresh riddles light
17385,had no lettuce or carrots and was all fuckin croutons and i loved it, hisses through teeth, oh shit it gets worse and worse and worse and worse
17386, okay here he goes everybody step back, yeah, right
17387, got the bad boy of podcasting, you do have to lose, i want to make it clear
17388, they thought you were gonna walk past that door and imyoure, now heres what i will say: bet against yourself, my strategy for this segment has always been to answer the riddle
17389,suggesting that we should turn back and maybe open it a crack and see, yeah now youre the ravioli champion there is a certificate in your,correctly
17390,whatssee whats in there,cubicle or whatever put a large amount of money against yourself, and my path to getting there has changed dramatically in the
17391, yeah you should open up your mind, that you wont make it into the ravioli hall of fame,same way that i feel like i have my finger on the yahoo pulse and that i
17392, you can putoh ive put cheetos on salad is that what you guys, oh,know how that collective hive mind operates i feel like im getting better at
17393,are talking about, ill get that ravioli madness,understanding how riddlescom submissions work and it is through that
17394, ive been doinlaughs i fuckin fucked this up already ive been, yeah,lens i want you to view my answer which is jesus christ
17395,to sheetz sheetz will putlegally sheetz will put anything on a salad they, thats always a risk justin, yeah
17396,dont care they dont care, thatlisten it might through laughter happen, right
17397, somebody does need to care, laughs, no please justin just say something
17398, if docking the boat is really just not sailing the boat anymore, that is a good question have you often won by two or three times, laughs
17399, that should be easy because ive spent the entirety of my life not,through laughter as much as everyone else because it might just be, wait a minute
17400,driving the boat,when youve eaten one more than the next person stop, that sounds a lot like my shitty friend garret
17401, so returning to that state shouldnt be a challenge, god i know right, so how about our first question
17402, this is getting like weirdly so specific like are you listening, i could go for some ravioli, you dont know which app to open okay
17403,deborah you cant just paint your nails and call yourself a captain, griffins right dont enter the ravioli competition let someone, laughs

18950, do you think itcan i stop for a second riddlemaster,worry about where your juice goes thanks to me and my juice removal,i always came in withmy numbers were in the toity theres no way
18951, you know how batman has a rule about not killing people right,service,around it folks
18952, do you think its weird that hes like the only superhero who has,so there was an argument i got into with a customer at jimmy johns, i thought i was working pretty hard but my numbers were in the
18953,to like come out and say holding back laughter i dont kill people,cause we used to sell dayold bread and you could get it for like a dollar,fucking toity and i dont know how i couldve possibly you know put shit
18954, like you think about itmost of em have that assumed and,and somebody came in and wanted to buy a thing of dayold bread but we,in a scanner faster i dont know what kind of hot tech my contemporaries
18955,batmans the only one who repeatedly has to say like i dont kill people,had sold all the dayold bread so they wanted to just buy regular bread for,were doing if they werethey had like you know fuckinglike fushigi
18956, yeah i know the wholemy whole steeze looks like i do kill,a dollar since we were out of dayold,skills like unstacking these papers and putting them andcollating them
18957,people,and i had to explain to them that that is not how it works and they said,and putting them in a scanner i dont know but it made me feel like
18958,spiderman doesntlike the green lanterns never like gruff voice i, well how old is that bread and i think they were trying to negotiate a,garbage and then thats why i quit that job on top and wasnt fired
18959,dont kill people like we know youreyoure just green its not a big,price based on that breads relative age, right
18960,deal anyway, at that point is it still coleslaw like i dont think, that istravis has said one helpful thing here just the one and
18961, yeah alright maybe when youre parallax, yes,its that everybody wants to find the way to work the least amount so like
18962, okay okayokayokay, no,youre not alone in this
18963, okay, incorrect, youre not alone in this endeavor and so like you have that to
18964, every time he does this the audience always gets really quiet as, then teresa if i may it sounds like you know exactly what shes,rest on youre not gonna get in a bunch of trouble people are gonna be
18965,iand i know the thought in every one of your minds is serious tone im,doing with it,like youoh i see you also were trying to work the least amount that you
18966,gonna solve this thing, uhhuh,could but you didnt work as hard at that as i did and so i did catch you
18967,audience laughs, okay, oh fucking slam em
18968, right yes i got you okay and then it like makes it so quiet that, heres, that would be fucking
18969,you have to hear all of the words that travis says okay, i dont want to get too scientifical here but, so tight if you took like 50 papers and like graded like 99
18970, go ahead travis,  im gonna tell you guys the issue here and that is that we are,percent of each one of them
18971, to the tune of nature boy there was a boy,looking at it backwards because it is not the addition of cabbage to juice, and somebodys like oh looks like i finally overtook ya
18972, um ii mean he wouldntif the if the hula hoop had a nata,that makes it coleslaw it is rather that we must look at it and say that the,laughs and then you go in
18973,manufactured break in it designed to unsnap so the boy could put it around,removal of the cabbage from the juice does not make it no longer coleslaw,  and you just clear those out in like 10 minutes and youre like
18974,him i guess it wouldnt be broken and thats not a funny thing to say but,let me explain you have a bowl of juice you put one sliver of cabbage in,uh check again
18975,that is how the brains of the riddlescom users work so im trying to get,that is not coleslaw what have you done but you start with a bowl full of,and then theyre gonna absolutely flip shit
18976,inside,cabbage right and then slowly take some away until all the cabbage is, yeah
18977, thats it i mean,removed it continues to be coleslaw, or you go through their papers and find all the mistakes that they
18978, thats the end of riddle me piss it has to be they cant get, until it is zero cabbage i would say it is still coleslaw,missed because they also are trying to pull the samelisten
18979,worse than that, i think its just water, the american education systems in a lot of trouble guys
18980, it was just a dream, i think its just water, how about a yahoo

19104,you never know, well griffin let me explain to you its fun because people can,your body silver and you have a santa claus hat on and you have two
19105, sometimes they guess wrong and its the pits, so often the things we do on the show are just for us,present cannons and your legs

19116,goin with justin,  if we included a moment like that where somebody would be,seconds and go fucking hogwild destroy the place and then roll out and
19117, this is a purely one way transaction and tim robbins knows it my,like  i helped the brothers figure out how many times travis saw pirates of,then theyll be like who the fuck was that
19118,goal is to get the smallest little sliver of tim robbins without him noticing,the caribbean franchise in theaters, yeah

20032,  that we would never recover its like ep one right that its,to remember people that he thinks or they think are shady,other foot
20033,likewe like unintentionally dox somebody like for sure day one ep, so maybe zach just seems like a real upstanding individual and, also yknow what you cant go wrong with a good nine and a half

20049, well, laughs, you know restaurants that are made like the old western saloon
20050, yes, well okay griffin though counterpoint zach wouldnt have,  for example the atmosphere is very stylistic the restaurant has
20051, yes,written an email that was like  hey theres this guy ted who doesnt know,pictures wallpaper nice fancy clock and they have really fine looking tables
20052, well thats gonna do it for us laughs thanks for listening to my,my name,and the piano is at the corner for the pianist theres a nice carpet on the
20053,brother my brother and me uh my name is justin mcelroy, laughs,floor i mean with chain restaurant even olive garden you dont get this
20054, this has been the aforementioned podcast and kiss your dad, fair,kind of stuff anymore so thats what a saloon is
20055,square on the lips, whoa, in an old western voice well thems some right purdy pictures
20056,theme song its a departure by the long winters plays and ends, oh so maybe youre going to initiate play,you got hangin up on the wall with your wallpaper and the nice fancy clock

20059,comedy and culture, laughs,you kidi have fucking carpet in here get the fuck out of here
20060,artist owned, okay now these are two different questions, lets ignore the fact that this person has no idea what saloons is
20061,listener supported, wildly different questions, but why arent there restaurants anymore are like the old western
20062,upbeat jazzy christmas music plays in background, now,saloon is a question that i would also like answered
20063, hello and welcome to my brother my brother and me an advice, is it his, its not the same
20064,show for the modern era im your olldest brother justin mcelroy, uhhuh, its got uh like for one thing theres a lot of anachronisms right
20065, uh ohhh, okay first of all justin buzz aldrin would swallow it if he was,theres air conditioning theres probably refrigerated food and ice
20066, theres a turkeyyy in the studio,trying to smuggle it come on, i like it in saloons in the movies and tv shows with cowboys in it
20067, yeah yeah if you could get the turkey, laughs,where they sit at the bar and they just sort of grab a bottle of warm brown
20068, dillip, this is the diheres why i think these are two wildly different,stuff and give them a big cup of that and i guess they just
20069, as everyone knows we may need a little bit of set up here if you,questions because if leonardo da vinci was alive today i think he could do, and i guess they just know what that is and like drinking it um
20070,dont follow the news and perhaps no ill say it  its most illadvised,whatever the fuck he wanted,thats cool
20071,policy, right hes leonardo da vinci maybemaybe a zombie but at the, thats pretty cool thats pretty cool
20072, this administration has decided that all pardoned turkeys must live,very least hes leonardo da vinci and hes like 800 years old or whatever, laughs
20073,with us or any other podcaster, right buzz aldrin, that should be customary absolutely
20074, our name got pulled out of the hat, right, do yall think
20075, of course everybody knows about stinky fred the turkey that lives, i dont thinklike do you thinklike say tom banksy the street, back in cowfolks days
20076,at the joe rogan show and uh im just hopingwhat podcaster do you,artist walked into a museum and said  thats mine give it back, they would be sittin around in the saloon with the joke door with
20077,guys hope gets a turkey next year, yes and it doesnt go anywhere just a side note,the spit canister with the warm brown stuff with the fights and poker and
20078, in the fiction that weve crafted whose house is the turkey in did, uhhuh,probably smoke and probably stinky people in general um they were all
20079,we each get, yeah,probably sitting around like  gang we can do better than this right
20080, okay, no beand i can tell you right now all buzz aldrin would have to,  like doesdoeshey guys like i get it its the wild west and
20081, yeah and heres the,do is to say while looking in the eye of this person  im allowed to do this,things are rough and yknow a lot of things havent been invented yet and
20082, heres the twist that makes this really special and why i think this, and you would sayi dont even think you would need to invoke,thats too bad i cant wait for that stuff to get invented but ill for sure be
20083,is coming this fall at nbc is that um one of us is a coyote,the name of the smithsoi think you could just say  im allowed to do,dead before that happens so like can we just be a little cleaner in here
20084, and that makes things so funny and a little bit sexy with all of the,this and no living human being would say  no youre not buzz aldrin,could we hold ourselves to a slightly nicer standard in here
20085,fuckin turkeys runnin around, laughs, it does rain and even if iteven if it didnt rain were all just

21003, i dont know if that was parthesokay so heres the wild thing, but rachel you now have the insight that you can share with our, that is ayou have made a pale mockery of twentyfunny: fill
21004,the second guy who ate the banana is a performance artist and he ate the,listeners at home is that just a funny persona griffin puts on for the radio, and if were gonnaif were gonna have like a shadow camp i feel
21005,original art can you do that, thats a good character that griffin plays at home rock solid, oh we all do we all do

22502, um does everybody laughs does everybody feel kind of, hey real quick can we just for a moment acknowledge that,cup when i ask for a water cup dont they trust me
22503,bummed out by how static the level of cravable innovation has been,there is a delivery person that this food was ordered and they knocked and, theres probably some sort of you know big capitalist energy
22504,audience cheers,it didnt answer and they were just like  ill leave it on the porch,answer for this question of just like they dont want you to drink the water
22505, fear not fear not, like whoa,they want you to drink the cocacola and so they want you to run out of
22506, taco bell has taken cravable innovation to the next level, that cant be protocol,water see joe sixpacks cocacola over there and

22510,indulgence in this elevated chalupa experience, wow i mean how dohow do parents now know how to take care, that is
22511, this is a very accurate subhead because if you eat the toasted,of their children, that is for sure not 100 percent water there isyoure gonna get
22512,cheddar chalupa and someones like  what are you doing the proper, oh right,some hic on that
22513,response is  i dont fucking care, i bet there was a lot of like angels showing up that first time, um but they probably do not trust you
22514, im literally carefree not about my body not about my spirit,around god was like  youre on your own and then adam and eve had a, theyve probably been hurt a lot before i knowi dont think this
22515, yeah im free of caring,baby and god was like  oh shit okay wait,is going on as much anymore but there was the very terrible uh like
22516, fuck yeah it is this is taco bell,  do go down there and tell them not to give them marbles or,youtube prank going on sort of the opposite of the fill your life with
22517, you guys are having a lot of fun with the fucking subhead of this,whatever,laughter and love challenge where people

22519,getting a nextlevel cheesy glow up introducing the toasted cheddar,them to cook that food oooh please,yeeting it like directly right back into the
22520,chalupa, laughing, yeah baby fucking let that one rip
22521,audience cheers, mm good point, that one juice loving it holy shit
22522, confirmed for nationwide release, do you guys think if there was some point where the first people, oh my god thats a crisp one bud
22523, we just checked with ourselves we are definitely doing this folks,the first parents were like  you think this thing eats, what was that
22524,you cani like that that sounds like a threat you cant reason with us,  its gross right this is gnarly right we can all agree that, fucking yes baby
22525,weve confirmed it,should we talk to him, shit thats
22526,  the toasted cheddar chalupa presents brilliantly simplistic shell,  no he doesnt know how to use the clam shells,  so gnarly okay so thats not good it was bad that they did
22527,innovation by baking real aged cheddar cheese onto the shell since the,  i use the clam shells i have these three shells that i use to clean,that so maybe that sort of uh meant that just mankind could not be trusted
22528,classic chalupa was first introduced in 1999 taco bell has consistently found,my butt and he doesnt use it right,with water going through a drive thru um
22529,new ways to create all new chalupa experiences,  i mean its a living, but im a
22530,  whether its flavor innovation like the baja chalupa in 2000 size,  can you go ask fred flintstone what he did to get his kid to use, i think that all the cups should be smaller
22531,innovation with the 2017 launch of the double chalupa,their bidet, i think when iif you go to a applebees and they give you a
22532,  or protein innovation with the naked chicken chalupa, no thats barneys kid beats the shit out of him all the time,smaller water cupthis is not a thing that happens at any chain restaurant
22533,audience cheers, laughs,this is only fast food yes
22534, thats a munch squad favorite its a fuckin wack chicken breast, laughs, okay
22535,that they folded into a taco shut up, ill take it one step further and clarify for those listening not only, thats a good point travis okay well when im at the fast food
22536,   naked chicken chalupa that same year the chalupa experience,do i not know where to get weed i dont know how to ask somebody where,restaurant im just saying have you seen the size of some of these sodas
22537,has no boundaries and that is a threat,to get weed so like i am now in a position where its like i dont know, im so happy that my car started to drag its front end and flipped
22538, that is a threat were not stopping here folks we are nowhere,where to get it and im too afraid to ask because im pretty sure if i walked,upsidedown and i had to drive to work upsidedown
22539,near the fuckin rubicon  at taco bell heres a quote from liz matthews,up to another human being and said  from whom might i purchase, that is brutalist desibrutalist office design
22540,chief food innovation officer at taco bell corp  at taco bell we get excited,marijuana they would be like  oh youre a cop, laughs its a literal spike through laughter its an actual spike
22541,by the whatifs, well i mean listen hey you want to cut through the bullshit,thats what hellraiser drinks out of
22542, it gets us rock hard excited about the whatifs   we can dream up,justin yes, or turn it into a fun bird beak or a crosstalk
22543,and bring to life for our fans it is a living sentient being, i can buy that medical shit and i do but im saying thats not, fun hat
22544,  and the toasted cheddar chalupa is an example of just that we,cool thats not a cool feeling right thats not, im just saying some of these cups are so big i fell in one and
22545,know cheese makes everything better and ba  eh within limits  and, no that is cool listen  thats cool but i never had,drowned once
22546,baking aged cheddar into the shell of an already iconic product is a game, i know yeah its fucked up, its the
22547,changer for our fans our fans will love i dont know what the game is, maybe this is one of those scenarios where you could just say like, how could that be true
22548,but i feel weve all lost already, hey do you sell weed because i bet if they do theyre happy for the, this is not how itlaughs this is not what this question means
22549, hey i think your copy of operation is fucked,customers right like if youre someone who sells weed you like selling, that cant possibly
22550,  if theres one this things ten paragraphs long yall we gotta,marijuana to people right like thats youre probably looking for new, right so just squish a pizza box under there thats how a
22551,haul ass,customers right right,kindergartener would fix it but i
22552,  if theres one sure sign of the latest foodie craze its a line, oh man, i think its two separate ideas
22553,stretching around the block thats why tac , i thought i was onto something, i think the landlord ordered a hotnready and treated themselves
22554, okay listen though mumbling if theres one sure sign of the, but heres the thing  in this day and age everybodys sellin,to it as they did the dirty sink work
22555,latest foodie craze its a line stretching around the block  thats why taco,something justin, they didnt fix theyoure going at this with like wild lucasarts
22556,bell is giving a few fans the chance to try taco bells latest cravable, so maybe its not weed but youre like  hey imdo you sell,adventure game logic nobodys ever used pizza box on sink
22557,innovation before its even available nationwide but because the foodiest,weed and theyre like  no but i do make yknow handmade hacky, the sink was too low
22558,hot spots are all the best kept secrets fans will have to uncover where the,sacks or whatever  and ill sell them to you and youre like  oh okay, so it leaked sinks are very very particular
22559,advance tastings of toasted,so now i need to find somebody whos looking for hacky sacks to trade for, yeah
22560,   cheddar are being served for themselves,weed but then you find somebody whos like trading hacky sacks for like, gasps
22561, the most wild thing about this paragraph and im sure theres,crochet patterns or whatever and eventually you will find somebody who, are we here for this or
22562,more wild things about the other paragraphs but this paragraph,will take your uh i dont know your antique waffles for weed, i was gonna follow their lead
22563,specifically is that they are basically saying like  wouldnt it be weird if, well i meant like from an antique waffle maker i didnt mean like, is this like a smarter than a fifth grader like youre gonna
22564,we were like real food,they were super old waffles,embarrass us
22565, its basically like food face like theyre pretending to be food its, heres the thing i would warn you about question asker you, can i ask one last question isare you getting these questions
22566,a perversion of what we understand food to be like what if taco bell was,dont have any connection to this person doesnt sound like you had any,from some sort of disreputable website
22567,like food laughing that youd buy at a restaurant wouldnt that be wild,interest in being their friend even though it sounds like they live next to, huh probably an even number i would guess
22568,anyway,you and so i think maybe get to know them or if you dont want to do, im gonna say 32 times
22569, they havent published the locations though thats whats secret,that dont, oh its an odd number interesting
22570, not not uh do you mean an alternate reality gordita no it is, dont open up uh the relationship with one of bartering quality, ohh and at one point shaggy does say  it was not me
22571,not,because i think that would put some strain no pun intended on the, that does not count
22572, um  the toasted cheddar chalupa is not just one of this years,neighborly relationship, five
22573,biggest innovations from taco bell its also the largest international release, you could set up though like maybe a pulley rope system, cool imcomedy rule of threes come on third ones gonna be
22574,of a menu item from taco bell since the naked chicken chalupa in 2017,between houses where they send over little,super funny
22575,starting this month and for a limited time the menu item will also be, fuck i forgot youre right griffin i forgot cause i had watched, fourteen

23078, makes beeping sounds, and then voltron uses his mighty space sword to cut the umbilical, oh new york city baby
23079, breaking this just came in this is breaking news,cord, the big apple
23080, this is a breaking, but hes a doula, so i stole a penguin from the zoo because i read a cool uh book
23081, whoa yeah this is a breaking haunted doll watch just came in i, its just he would be so useful in this time yknow,a cool autobiography about a penguinhaver that i really liked and so i
23082,got a notification i love when it happens when im at a show already its, hes a doula,thought i would get uh one for myself and how do i get it back into the

23092, its the perfect scam this is from curious imports, oh yeahhh, i think that if im at zoo
23093, this is written in the stylei mean, yeahhh theres a long scene where titanic and voltron very, and i ask one of the animals if it wants to come home with me
23094, yeah its structured in a very fun way,  sensuously make love,and it saysit indicates that it does
23095,audience laughter, no its, i dont think its right that the zoo would be able to stop that
23096,  protection troll, its tasteful, i think if i go to the penguin exhibit at the st louis zoo and i walk
23097,  new resin stands four inches high measurement does not, oh yeah well that happens actually at the beginning of the,up and those penguins are so close and i see a cute little rockhopper he

23105,  no one can bringmake sure that no one can harm you or come, uh i should mention jack doesnt survive once they get to, rwaa
23106,in your life to bring harm we all know some people like that,america but its for completely unrelated reasons,i should be able to take him home or else its not zoo is it its jail

23163,work for some people, yeah laughs as a species maybe we need to focus more on like,awfully cavalier about open and frank conversations about getting our
23164,  that was a test there isnt one anyway thats your haunted doll,what is making your yard conducive,buttholes sprayed by our toilets in the form of bidet seating
23165,watch for this this week,  to cat fuckin, and obviously its important obviously its important its an
23166,audience cheers, well i mean like i said i think that you could just universally,important facet of my life justins life travis life um keepin it clean down
23167,theme music plays,describe things that would make anything horny yknow like as youve,there gettin the spray is i love it and i need it but i dont think the
23168, hello,already said a saucer of milk comfortable sheets um,rest of america is ready to go there with us yet
23169, youre completely justified, so human movies, i think that thats better yeah cause bidet is like a french word
23170,audience laughter, any movie about humans,and i think a lot of people are still kind of sore about like all the iraq war
23171, establish dominance, that might be part of the problem,stuff
23172, yeah do you eat bacon as a rule or, comfortable sheets yeah, and so like if we could just call it like a booty super soaker or
23173, damn it, well ino this is just spitballing i was just throwing noodles,something like fun like that
23174, that was my whole thing, no but maybe theres something replicating comfortable sheets, my booty spray is but that sounds like actually something that
23175, you want this pig to be intimidated because shes eating vegetable,like maybe theres some really smooth ivy right and theyre like  ooh,could come out instead of go in
23176,bacon,this is the cat equivalent of sheets i want to bone on this right need to, uh so thats the bigthats sort of my big note no more bidet
23177, mmm,get rid of that ivy,chat maybe we have a separate podcast for um yknow folks more on
23178, yes, yep laughs just kept munchin em yknow maybe,our level
23179, youre gonna end up owning a lot of pigs, maybe its just that your yard is a place where cats feel comfortable, yeah
23180, yeah,having sex maybe its not an arousal thing theyre just like  yknow what, oh okay
23181,audience laughter,i feel like i can really be myself here and really let go its like the sandals, yeah
23182, but with pigs,for cats yknow they go they feel comfortable there its all inclusive and, sure
23183, you could just spin a web that says  dead meat,theyre able to let their hair down and really make love really i mean this, i think also in the spirit of the maxfundrive comin up pretty soon
23184,  get in line,is not this is uh for fun sex for these cats maybe,maybe we just lets have a conversation at least about cutting bugatti
23185,audience laughter, they would just say  our pajamas,boys the segment in our show where we talk about all our bugattis and our
23186,  i wont allow it its a good pig charlotte you could try some, boisterous,new colors of bugattis and the news about new bugattis that are comin
23187,stuff that intimidates me so maybe bring up sports in conversation, uhhuh,out
23188, bring up sports or different kinds of cars that there are, uh i dont know maybe a tarp, what not bugatti boys
23189, and you could bring up those while youre talking to the pig and, yknow up on sticks so you have room underneath it so the cats, my bugattis
23190,the pig will be if the pig is anything like me uh permanently intimidated,can see from the side but god looking down from the sky cant see around, right
23191, yay,the tarp, can yall even just and ill cut this out but if we could get a bidet
23192, cowles, cant see through em its like his lead,in the bugat

23432,came in the week before as a coleslaw fan and then they fucking mainline, i have always said that zaxbys their number one thing is, laughing good
23433,coleslaw juice and realize like  ive been wasting my time with all the,bringing people together, no i think actually to differentiate
23434,chewing chewing chewing i need to just get the juice its the only thing i, oh wait are you guys not doing that in your house like when, yeah please fucking dont play along at home
23435,crave,bebe comes to eat im like  12, thats travis thing
23436, so heresdont get ahead of me  i told her no but the ensuing, ooh, hm
23437,argument made me think should i have charged her the first time,  read a book, um i think gi
23438,  should i have just given it to her the second, you cant kill zaxbys by conventional methods, its a trap yeah its a giamatti trap its a giamatti snare who
23439,  surely if it was only one piece of cabbage in the liquid that isnt, laughs,was the second one
23440,coleslaw, yeah, is that arrow
23441,  but where is the line what is the exact ratio of liquid to cabbage,  were gonna be airdropping white castle all over this nation, ima go with arrow
23442,at which point the mixture stops being slaw and isnt worth money also i, stronger together, so he named it that because its like a cool thing that his super
23443,do not know what this woman was doing with the juice but she said she, we have been looking forzaxbys has been looking for its chance, his badass superhero laughing
23444,liked it so much quote she could just drink it and thats from teresa,to grow yknow and sometimes sometimes uh that little tree in the, yeah yeah yeah its like a
23445, there he goes,forest needs another tree to maybe fall over to uh get a little more, have you guys ever had val kilmers kickass bat wine
23446, laughs i dont even know whats in coleslaw if im being honest,sunlight on that little tree zaxbys is hoping some of its uh big siblings, its super good and the joker hates it
23447, theres a vinegar element to this,maybe go down in this so zaxbys ends up being stronger than ever, would that be
23448, so i think what youre getting in the juice is vinegar and a little, ten years, laughing is it lil jon
23449,pump of mayonnaise and then like brokedown like molecules of, we haveso this is a big thing we should talk about too uh, laughs
23450,cabbage right,because with our ten year anniversary we decided to do uh, that thing that you just said though did you reis that like
23451, right the breakdown of that i think is creating the water,  a little bit of rebranding,printed on the bottle cause that was a bunch of wild shit

23472, woahhoho, kind of like keha a little bit there,  if you stink at golf can you just throw the ball
23473, i do this to my kids, is thereis there some kind of spam sensor out there that if they, is that against the rules yeah if you do this at the pga masters
23474, when they ask for more liqi dont trust my kids with a larger cup,hadnt censored that the phone would be like  oh my and wouldnt allow,the big show uh the big beautiful game uh they are going to you will
23475,than i care to clean up with a paper towel,it through,getyou will be penalized

23477,floor and so i dont give them anyits my fault at that point, aww,current score or now you dont get tonow your caddy you dont get a
23478, if i have to clean up something larger than a very small cup of, i crafted that just for them yknow heres the thing,caddy anymore so you gotta carry the things yourself
23479,water thats on me, i was gonna do a funny bit where like i pretended to not know, um i think its pretty ridiculous i think its pretty ridiculous and
23480, laughs thats my day,what some of the words in the text meant but then you got to the emoji,frankly kind of embarrassing to think that if youre not good at the game if
23481, mm,part and i was literallyi was literally like,youre not good at like hitting the ball with clubs that you can just pick it
23482, crosstalk are you kidding me i gotta hear more about these, i was lost whatwhywhy the mice why the mice i guess,up and throw it right
23483,big sodas, oh, but but but
23484, laughs are they si have never thought about that are they, but see youve introduced already a cat kind of imagery, what if you could do that
23485,conical so you cant set them down, right and then you introduce mice and im getting turned, right
23486, i just assumed they were cheaper to produce but there is,around, you break theits called breaking the seal
23487,something about like  i dont want fucking cups everywhere, have you thought about writing back griffin, once you break the seal everybodyso you gotta watch out for if
23488,  here you go now you have to throw them away, maybei dont think it has to be committal i think you could write,your opponent can throw things super far
23489, little crown of a bad kingdom,back like  im not interested in clicking the link but how are you today, and its not just about how far you can yeet this golf ball its also
23490, laughs  i am a law school student living in a pretty okay,right like i dont think you have to,about the precision game right its about your approach and its about
23491,apartment and ive been in this apartment since i started law school about, in smyrna id imagine,yknow you go up against somebody who was on the bozos grand prize
23492,a year and a half ago my landlord has been pretty okay up until now but, oh,game
23493,he just did something that has blown my mind, huh, theyre gonna be draining buckets left and fucking right um and
23494, i asked him to fix my sink because it was leaking from the bottom and he, yeah its nice to have one foothold in the whole thing yknow,maybe you want that maybe you dont but i do think that if you stink at
23495,said hed do it during a time when id be in class past experience told me,like well at least new smyrna ford was it or chevrolet,golf you can justyou should just be able to throw the ball
23496,this is fine so i let it happen i come back to my apartment and the sink is, oh, that i dont like
23497,sitting on top of a folded pizza box, uhhuh, no i dont like that golf balls not good to kick cause its little
23498,  of a folded pizza box, okay,and so its like easy to miss it and its hard so it can hurt the foot but
23499,  its fixed but brothers i have no idea where this pizza box came, were kind of like first responders if you think about it,picking it up and throwing it like thats got a good hand feel to me like
23500,from, laughs,a golf ball leaving my hand with tremendous force i like that
23501,  did he bring it with him i havent eaten pizza in two months,  oh yeah of course that sounds terrible heres a free chevy, just an organic rube goldberg machine
23502,what do i make of this, ugh you monsters, mmhmm
23503, thats from cassie in albany, every time, thats basically the legend of bagger vance
23504, what it sounds like to me, is it the spice level do you think, the shia lebeouf one
23505,  is that he fixed the sink through laughter by putting a pizza, yknow what yknow what needs to make a comeback ive just, sorry
23506,box under it,decided based off ofyou said hear music justin and it got me thinking, i dont think you should be able to use that
23507, im trying to work throughheres what i think might be happening,like an organ grinders monkey right, theres probably a few i think if you can get up to it you should
23508,here is that the folded pizza box is sort of like underneath the basin and, cause you leave the burrito there they open the door theres a,be able to throw your opponents ball backwards
23509,its sort of like pushing it up,monkey the monkey tips its little hat maybe holds its hand out you hand, but then its like aits a sneaking game
23510, laughing,him a ten dollar bill and he scurries back up onto the delivery persons, you can do that you can plow right through them
23511, its justi dont know how youits leaking,shoulder a good 12 feet away, no lets stop jokin around
23512, its fixed the problem is, well no i dont think so, its international waters um but letsno joke you should be able
23513, okay, how about an organ grinders robot theres a little roomba there,to pick the ball up and throw it i feel like especially if you get in the sand
23514, and they were embarrassed that they ate a pizza in your house so,and the roomba tips his little hat and then vacuums your sidewalk back to,like you know how when youre watching like the masters and they get in
23515,rather than put it in your trash can they folded it up and jammed it under,the delivery person,the sand and then they spend like 30 minutes in there just like hitting
23516,your sink and in doing so somehow fixed the leakthe leak, laughs,sand over and over again and its annoying to fuckin watch that i want to
23517, laughs, mmhmm,see somebody hit it on the green part thank you very much
23518, theres justthe reason i put ittheres gottatheres one still, this is a true thing that happened to me 100 and it sounds i, yeah
23519,image in the world that maybe cassie captured maybe they didnt that,know like a scary story but it really happened we ordered food and we, no theyll eat around it and then you have your ball good to go
23520,makes this all go away theres just one picture that would congeal the,left yknow the instructions were leave food on porch but but i was, what if it goes in shreks swamp and its like i dont want to
23521,entire situation in my mind and i cannot conceive of it,taking the garbage cans around front at the exact time that they pulled up,bother that dude like hes mean

23690,another pass at this,always like tried to keep me dancing pretty clean yknow with room for the,exhibits in the air and space museum
23691, yeah please,holy ghost and,  if buzz aldrin wanted to go to the smithsonian air and space
23692, did you know, and in the daytime too they said  you can dance in havana but,museum in washington dc and climbed into the original apollo 11 capsule
23693, i dont know its just like its soi justyou flush it and it goes,only during the daytime and with room for the holy ghost and i said  no,that they have on display could the museum staff stop him regular people
23694,to the sewer like i dont,no no no one puts travis in a corner and tonight im gonna dirty dance at,cant do this in museums but hes the whole reason its in the museum in
23695, because its filling from the same place as your potable water does,night in havana and they said  okay well i guess thats fine youre 36,the first place
23696,like all,so i justoh by the way i just saw it uh like last week,this question also applies to other situations like if leonardo da vinci was
23697, you have oneyou dont have a potable and nonpotable water, well i had just seen dirty dancing for the first time and i said i,alive and he went to the louvre could took the mona lisa off the wall and

23700, laughs no in your toilet is sink water its all in perspective,oh they go to havana that sounds intriguing, unless once buzz aldrin got inside the apollo 11 capsule and he
23701,baby, and they also kept saying  six feet six feet and i thought they,blasted off with it out of the museum to take it to his backyard where he
23702, no the same water you use to wash your lexapro down your,meant how wide i needed to spread my butt cheeks and i was trying,could charge children five dollars to climb inside and experience a space

23748,really mean and we can really stand behind it as true,yeah youre not lying about a law degree, yeah this is like why our sons original name was  guh just
23749, yeah please, i would argue that if you entered the contest without a husband,because thats the sound he liked to make and thats how names do work
23750, yeah thats a literary thing i just dont want you to say things you,and yelled so good that your future husband showed up you automatically,sometimes
23751,dont mean,win like you yell and someone walks up and is like  ii heard the call, laughs
23752, yeah just truth just truth speak in this episode id love to,and i had to come hi im jerry right and its like wow laughs, well you didnt call him haha did you

23754, you fucking dont have to clarify that, huh that was not at all what i was expecting, laughs

23756, okay this is interesting okay i wasi am in the same boat,and theyd be like  oh ill be right there and youre like  thats how good,  this is fake bullshit and
23757,travis i was informed last night by my wife of who the teams are in it um,i yell thats how good i yell i dont have to do, i think cut your losses juice

23760, laughing okay but i love that but i do want to say you said the, keith okay it did sound like she was just yelling  king king the, that was so fast
23761,chefs and i need to dial in and to see if you think the name of the,clock says dinner, okay
23762,professional football outfit is the chefs or if you have violated our contract, she justthe motivation hit and she was like  yknow what this, laughs
23763,of speaking the truth,wasnt the direction i was gonna go but and yknow what heres the sad, hes a nasty littlenasty boy and uh
23764, that could bethats debatable actually laughs it is a four and a,thing  she probably couldve gotten third if she had just stuck with her ori,  hey hows the show going bumbum died
23765,nine, i think the judges probably saw that flip flop in the middle and,  you and your brothers telling fun jokes youll never see bumbum
23766, laughs,they were like  mm nope no husbands coming to that,again
23767, i knewi knew that it was over when during my superbowl, no, can you read the next question itll get the taste out of my

23772,you didnt give a shit so which is it griffin, i like the subtle roy because a subtle roy is good if it turns out, oh
23773, im gonna say that i like just an event where a lot of people seem,you just didnt see him in the periphery and roy is like three feet to your,  shit
23774,to beyknow culture is so fractured now,left right and youre like  roy and roys like  im right here and, she fucking sniped your stink brah
23775, i like an event where everybodys just kind of on the same page,youre like  oh thank god okay but, yeah thats great i would argue that if somebody walks into a
23776,and watchin the same thing they dont really care about very much but at, because if you started off with a powerful roy and then you have,room and changes the entire aroma dynamic of that chamber it doesnt
23777,least were all gettin together and doin it,subtle roy standing next to you and hes like  that was too powerful you,matter how good or bad that smell is i think that smell is probably too
23778, like we used to yknow i thinki think i dont know and i,couldve been subtle im right here,assertive
23779,havent cared until, laughs, a bakery has its own colognewell are we calling dunkin a

23885,tell me if its anything okay cause im not really sure right now, whatwhat keeps happening,you michelle its by yahoo answers user carol who asks as i turn my
23886, yeah it is earnest this is something you could do um what if you, through laughter whats the connective tissue,video off  would you like pinecones more if they were alive and could crawl
23887,added a little bit of salt to the chili okay and then you tasted it and then, okay lets try it out griffin cough,around
23888,you added more salt and you just tasted it again and then you kept, oh bless you what do you say back, yeah i dont i dont dislike pinecones i certainly wouldnt say
23889,repeating that process until it was so salty that you couldnt you really just, have you heard the good news,like if we were walking through a pine forest
23890,couldnt yknow what i mean, bow likeoh like that, and somebody pointed at one of these little spikey bastards on
23891, and then the next day you do the exact same thing again and, letlet me try ill cough,the ground and said  do you like that i think i would probably say like
23892,with presumably more salt, heckum hackum heckum, eh itsits fine
23893, and soso yeah so what im thinking is that at the end of this, and also with you,  its okay
23894,experience it will have been difficult for you but youll be able to brag like,audience laughs loudly and cheers, whos that everwhos that been for ive seen peoi have done
23895,no matter how salty that chili is i will be able to enjoy it, do you wanna try,that before i think i did that at like a church camp almost certainly at
23896, i can take my chili saltier than anybody anybody you know i can, bless you,some point but like even when i was doing it i was like  who is this for
23897,take the saltiest chili down no problem a lot of people, okay,like is a deer gonna come eat this
23898, but the good news is no matter how salty a chili im never gonna, weve got three different good options, oh do birds like peanut butter thats wild
23899,send a chili back for being too salty a lot of people would try spice make it, okay, right
23900,spicier and spicier build up ai think that that reeks of a sort of false, bless you, laughs
23901,machismo, okay ive been wanting to talk to you for a while now about our, right
23902, i dont think you should do that,relationship, laughs theyre the same to justin its the same outdoors animal
23903, laughing,audience laughs and groans,to justin essentially
23904, laughing you deserve it for eating chili, you know what youre right, right
23905, laughing yeah but like you will have a fun personality quirk of, i think we can make this work, they dont bring your newspathey dont pick up your newspaper
23906,like  hey i went to go eat chili with derek and this is gonna sound insane, once i get out of here we can be together my characters in prison,and fly it in they certainly arent making you fucking dresses so that you
23907,but he unscrewed the top of the salt shaker and just dumped it right in,audience laughs,can go to the ball thats some bullshit that
23908, laughs, oh no, yeah thats some bullshit hollywoods trying to shove down our
23909, this is soim really enjoying this and that last one was kind of, to where,throats

23911,should stop for a moment to read the messages from our sponsors, twowheezes he built a rocket ship for me, so letsi mean ive had some time to think about it while you
23912,theme music plays, yeah and its a steampunk rocket ship so you know its cool looking,two have been talking a bunch of bullshit that doesnt mean anything and i
23913, alright travis now do advertisements without saying anything you, and whats that its captain mal reynolds,think it would be pretty badass if pinecones were just scuttling around
23914,dont mean, anyways do you wanna have sex in front of captain mal reynolds, uh thats a fun little toy story thing but i think you know what
23915, laughs, anybody here smart,would be better if they did it while i was looking
23916, very good yes, ooh, so i could see it and be delighted by it
23917, laughs i liked it, oh boy i assume it isyou know, i do think though that if you go to a michaels and they have craft
23918, i liked it, okay,pinecones those shouldnt move around cause michaels is a place of
23919, i liked it, thank you,business its not the forest
23920, imitates a guitar solo i wanna munch, you know how, but you know whatd be fucking funny guys
23921, continues guitar sounds i wanna munch,  there are trains full of, when like kids make little craft turkeys out of pinecones would
23922, continues guitar sounds pizza hut will reward the first set of twins,  gasoline,those move around too
23923,born after superbowl, okay there, youve never seen it
23924, pizza huts goin for two, yells how else does gravy get places, they use it like the body of the turkey cause it looks like a
23925, and hoping a couple lucky parents can convert on superbowl, yes,turkeys body
23926,sunday, yes, so it would be like crawling around and it would have sort of
23927, they mean give birth to human life the pizza restaurant returns to, yes,turkey paper stuff on it
23928,superbowl live for its second year as the official pizza sponsor of the nfl on, yes, i like that
23929,february 2nd this year the family that welcomes the first set of twins born, not now not now im saying a hundred years ago, what ifokay heres a fun thing that travis just said and he
23930,after kickoff is gonna get amazing prizes, i have never been embarrassed in my entire life,didnt even know it cause thats not how his brain works if pinecones could
23931, the press release goes on to say  familys always been part of, have you heard the jokes i make on this show,move around but turkeys now could not
23932,pizza huts dna which is why the restaurant will honor the mvps making,audience laughs, i think iti thinkand just to keep things fresh i think we should
23933,their own special deliveries this sunday the winning family will get a trip for, i am saying a hundred years ago everyone said oh yeah henry ford,probably do that every once in a while now does that mean that
23934,two to next years superbowl lv,and his car gravy,eventually
23935,  two years of free pizza and in honor of its ongoing commitment to, he loves that sh wheezes,  human beings wont be able to move around anymore and
23936,literacy through its iconic book it program well also reward 22000 to, through laughter it,then
23937,kick off the twins education funds along with a custom curated starter,audience laughs, well no itll be more itll be more sort of just like we cant move

23939,pick books to send to your children, no they just say horsepower, yep
23940,now one thing that i find engaging about this is that the people they have, that does mean at some point somebody had something that could be, do you think if pinecones started to move around
23941,chosen to fly someone to a football game for two they know for a,referred to as the gravy train and said thank god,  then we would start eating more of them
23942,motherfucking fact have two 12montholds almost to the day extremely, a butler came in going holding back laughter chugga chugga, like if youre
23943,close to that,wheezes, a meat
23944, so there is i would say a thin chance of the parents cashing this, chugga chugga would master likewheezes, laughing
23945,in i think its kind of a foolproof system theyve worked in the two years of, its a gravy locomotive a gravy, ah shit i mean what were saying is basically how hedgehog did
23946,pizza theyll be gaga about no question about it, a gravy caboose,happen

24104,upside down, yeah, okay well it was amaybe my bit recall is actually better than
24105, and maybe instead of not talking about bidets we could try to, no ilisten,im giving myself credit for
24106,educate people a little bit more about how theyre actually surprisingly, i understand what youre saying but i think what you are ignoring is i,uh but lets talk about this wheres the grapes cakes
24107,affordable,am a human being in the world who exists in society if i saw anybody eat, yeah
24108, and hygienic yknow,anything even if it was asparagus and a steak or whatever i wouldnt say you, right
24109, good for the environment saves on tp eco conscious,must be hungry because that persons a monster, hesitantly yes
24110, because theyre daunted by how relatable we are is that what, like walkokay tomorrow everyone in this room walk around the lido, its purple taste
24111,youre saying,market tomorrow, right
24112, three everymen you hear that youre like  wow thats a lot of, loudly you must be hungry you must be hungry because the answer, theres really not a good middle ground of both grapes is there
24113,men actually now come to think of it that may be too many men,is always yeah, itd be good grapes is good though actually travis im coming
24114,  for me to sort of talk to, i think the betterwhat they shouldve said is oh someone must be,back around love local fresh grapes
24115, i have actually been editokay this isthis is embarrassing i,shoplifting, but they dontbut theyre not making cakes of this stuff
24116,hate to do this here i have been editing out bugatti boys for the last four, i thought they were regular but they taste like disdainfully peanut, theyre making cakes of virtually every other flavor right
24117,years,butter, ive had so manyive had more lemon cakes than you could
24118, yeah, oh no i brought these oreos from home,shake a freaking stick at but ive never even
24119, yeah if you guys have been wondering why those sponsorship,audience laughs, and ive seen a lot of shows where they maketheyre makin stuff
24120,dollars have not been pouring in its because i have been editing the 45minute long bugatti centric laughs  segment we do every week, yells i left my money in the caaar,like this
24121, so what i do with that is because we endeavor to make tiger cub, okay, but nobodys
24122,chat as long as the actual episode itself i have edited in underneath the, big box store, but wheres my grape british brake off my grape british brake
24123,episode at a really low volume, bye,off
24124, so if youif theres ever a long period of silence thats why were, oh wow, let mefuck my grape british bake off where is it
24125,all talking so much talking over each other crosstalking its so we can, laughs but this is good this is theater of the mind, right
24126,cover up the chat about how weve adopted uh cubs and have named them, itsits all full its dark, its
24127,after our favorite us presidents thats constantly underneath the audio of, to be fair its not like the ship was sold out, its also entirely possible that alex included at some point in the
24128,us sort of prattling on about ghosts and horses and whatnot, oh,recipe so at some point youre gonna have to cook these grapes and
24129, ohh, imagine a horse has died you didnt care about it personally,then she was like i gotta warn people about what theyre getting into
24130, a bugattidet, you know ooh food,before
24131, hey rear facing, and it doesnt seem about looks who is everlike its mostly about, this is a sin against god i gotta give them a heads up before
24132, okay for the tiger cubs folks,smell right,they start mixin flour and whathaveyou
24133, yeah a rear facing harness, cause no matter how good it looks if youre like oh thats a goodlooking dishit smells like shit, they need something in there huh
24134, then hes rear facing until hes three and he can turn around and, that looks like a mistake you made by blending ingredients, yeah
24135,i like to think of that as roar facing,crosstalk, let it stand on its own merits
24136, cause hes directing the roars directly at you so from rear facing, it might also betheres a possibility that your coworkers food is so bad, laughs
24137,to roar facing,that the other coworkers are saying that looks great, laughing
24138, oh dipping your tiger cub in copper and freezing it for time and, yeah aww good job, warm harvest winemakers
24139,memorial, singing and this receive him king anyway, that sounds haunted
24140, hes fully animate, like fresh scallions from your office box, pink
24141, well also cause were burning up all our material i dont know, and they just start narrating in the moment like and uh im just, yellow
24142,what were gonna talk about during those segments that we will continue to,gonna microwave this at three minutes on high oh a little bit of sour cream on, butbut grapes arent necesighs oh shit trav
24143,record despite the revelation that they are not included in the show,there cut up some scallions voila, its kind of clear on the inside isnt it paul hollywood
24144, yeah we gottaive got the whole afternoon cleared out for all the, there is a moment in every chili cooks life where they said i think this, coming over here talking smart about my grape cake
24145,different shows that we have to record,is chili,i dont think this flavors gonna be good in your cake
24146, uh our first question is this  at my college we have a buffetstyle, alright open your mind justin,well paul hollywood have you ever had a fucking grape cake
24147,cafeteria i grabbed a plate of the chefs meal of the day sat it down at an, its thick chili,no actually why arent we makingwhy arent we making cakes out of
24148,open table with my backpack and then went to go get a drink i came back, its solid chili,these little guys
24149,with my drink and enjoyed my meal before wondering where my backpack, its frozen in a block, i love these guys i eat em all the time i never even made a
24150,was and then i looked down two tables to see my backpack and my original, thank you for asking my chili what i,cake with these guys and i make lots of cakes this is weird
24151,plate of food i had sat down at the wrong table and had eaten someone, everyone knows, laughs paulspauls grape cake
24152,elses identical meal without realizing it, but im going to shark tank it, oh thank you i just bought it at the cppe store
24153,i quickly left afterwards out of fear and shame correct  brothers in what, but youoh,no i didnt say great cape
24154,way could i atone for this sin to the unknown individual whom i accidentally, but then you kept bringing it in every friday,what
24155,dine and dashed on thats from momo in virginia, to the point where theyre like quietly should we say wehave we, jesus
24156, momooo, thats true of most people who have finished high school, how many colors do you two think you can make
24157, thats a good blend to start with, uh a lot of people dont go back and youre like you know what let, yeah can i finish
24158, mmhmm,me try math again, right who is that who is that is that fucking ross perot
24159, well maybe i mean thats a possibility travis i dont i sighs, unless youre dreaming through laughter at which point that does, fuck thats funny
24160,im really challenged by the exfiltration from the situation because option,happen to me a lot, did you getoh you got a little confused there
24161,one is realize the mistake stand up walk away and theres a sort of zone, your mom thinks youre garbage, yeah
24162,of i like to think of it in social situations as the zone of culpability,scattered cheering, oh i know i know yeah your brain got scared and confused
24163, like if you can make it if you can make it ten feet away from a, your mom is burning you left and right,of the truth
24164,thing you can sort of like blend into the crowd, i saw this garbage and thought of you laughs, we gotta stwe gottaokay if we sit here and talk about our
24165, and maybe even start announcing like  who did this who did this, through laughter go back to high school,favorite colors
24166,thing who couldve done this, that would be nice if dad when he texts me like hey do you, okay but im talking about what were currently doing which is
24167, but ii think that the other optionso thats option one option,remember jim johnson he died,talking about our favorite colors
24168,two is you realize your mistake and then take it to the trash and then,if the rest of that text was and i dont expect you to care about it at all, its not gonna be fun or entertaining
24169,you are running into the possibility of this person seeing you take their food, its fine ignore this, the bias has alreadylike weve been at this for 00 seconds and
24170,and throwlaughing didnt see you eat it but did see you pick up their, youi realize that you had through laughter no personal attachment,the bias has already fucking crept in and polluted the game so lets take a
24171,plate take it to the garbage and empty it out which is also very bad,to him whatsoever i just needed to use up some minutes i had on my phone,step back and well take blue and green off the table for a minute until we
24172, just go home, shes gonna come to your house and be like wheres the bottleoh,can talk about it like scientists and adults
24173, momo what did you do what did you do with your original plate of, but what ifunless, yeah yeah
24174,food, ohii said but it andand thats nothing, were gettin close alright im gonna take it in a different
24175, cause now you just have a big plate of cold spaghet and you, i was going to say a check but yes,direction with red you can scare a bull
24176,gotta decide like am i gonna have to eat okay theres three options, yeah they, butbulls chargingokay travis lets play in the fuckin space
24177,one people see you empty it into the trash wasteful ricky not good, and whatwhats great about that is that literally the pastor is saying,for like a minute scientifically okay
24178, laughs and threw it away  im full everyone should be full im,normally its worthless but , lets hypothesize in the space bull is charging at you what color
24179,throwing this in the trash,  maybe there is secret money in it,do you want your handy little towel to be
24180,  kids im done get back in the car thats possibility one, at which point through laughter you look like a dick, right
24181,possibility two slide it into your backpack, thethe mormons love givingcrosstalk, yeah
24182, and you have to get a new backpack but at least youve tamped, all thatall that lesson taught you is look in the bible through, yeah thatsso im trying to think of like practicality right
24183,down the shame three is you eat a second plate of delicious chefs,laughter before you throw it away, thats a few colors though isnt it travis
24184,spaghetti and thats fine i guess its a lot of carb maybe you do a half, hey this bibles empty laughs, dude and those videos are badass
24185,marathon or something, ah another one of these calls, like we can all agree on that but its so far from being
24186, yeah thats a good point, oh, and they just like live there

24188, yeah perfect in this, squad,clear jello cakes
24189, sorry go ahead, hey welcome to justin brand eats, i fucking love that dude thats a good color i think so far if
24190, ive decided in the grand tradition of evolution of the show that, shouts distantly fuck off,were doing it with an unbiased stance
24191,im gonna start outsourcing some of these to quora which is like the, oh my god let me see your ring its got pewheezes, my red scares the bull argument is still sort of in the lead
24192,smart its like the actual good alternative its positive universe yahoo, okay, because its the oneits the only color you were gonna want if a
24193,answers, soyes this was my greatgrandmaswheezesring,bulls coming to get you
24194, and so theres a question here  what do they call the outfits that, it says here mcelroy brothers industry oh no, so unless anybody has something that can beat the red scares the
24195,farmers wear and i thought that that would be perfect right because, i thought only superman could make diamonds,bull
24196,youre getting um uh kind of ayou want to get the look right right, holding back laughter no listen to podcasts, i was just thinking about bees trav
24197,cause if perfect in this scenario is to be like the perfect farming look is, creative, but i dont think they give a fuck about color do they
24198,that fair can we grant this conceit, wait hold on justin arent they, thats multiple colors i dont think if you
24199, so janice here has worked with farmers for decades and she, laughs as is legally binding, yeah
24200,answers  clothes, oh no, quietly oh shit
24201,  sure some farmers wear coveralls or overalls which is what tv, hey so mikeys here tonight if anyoneslaughs quietly, beepurple
24202,shows and movies would have us all think farmers wear but most of the, thats a ring pop, unintelligible
24203,farmers i know just wear clothes, thatno thats how hed propose, laughs well when you look at the color spectrum right and lets
24204,  depending on the work i know farmers who wear long sleeve, i will,put on ourlets do itsometimes boys i like to be a little bit nerdy and i
24205,plaid shirts and others who wear sports wicking shirts some wear jeans, through laughter its what ive been waiting for since i was a little,like to really geek it up its like just past like indigo purple ultraviolet
24206,while others wear shorts this is getting a little dr seuss for my taste,child,right
24207, now heres the part where this kind of like gets kind of fuckin, what, so like i just imagine it keeps going and then its like ultraultraviolet it gets purpler and purpler and purpler
24208,weird laughs janice then writes  here is a dairy farmer friend working on, imagine it like this griffin is my love,so like bees they see all the cool colors that we can see but they can see
24209,his farm two different days one day he looked like a stereotypical farmer,screech screams someones gonna die,the dankest fucking purples that are so purple like our brains cant even

24397,among us can say why a relationship between two beautiful talented and, because hes so reliable and like dependable and yknow youre,roadblock

24654, bumbum is not in perfect condition i have given him or the spirit that, is that anything, right yeah
24655,resides in him the name bumbum, the fact that, yeah travis was ruined from day one
24656,  i named it cause i want to be murdered in my sleep uh  i, the fact of the matter is there aretheres like nothingno food, we got our first itunes review where somebody was like eh
24657,named him that because in the middle of the night i will hear a sort of,stuff that i just like will absolutely not eat like if other people eat it,pretty good and travis wasthats whatthats what did travis he
24658,chanting in a very low weird voice saying bum bum bum bum bum,somewhere chances are ill eat it but there are plenty of things that if you,spoiled
24659,bum bum bum bum and then laughter so fucking maybe tom green,like give me the option that id be like  oh id rather have that than that, hes just been spoiled milk
24660,actually,like yknow what i mean, was that not a present from you to him
24661,  almost every morning when i come down into my office he is on, oh, yeah
24662,top of one of my other dolls, ooh, but have you noticed now that hes got a pretty constantly clean
24663, laughs okay, yeah,hole like how has he been since that
24664,  he has also pushed things off the shelf and has made strange, or potentially your husband also doesnt enjoy carrots and was, have you noticed a sort of
24665,laughing sounds when im not in the room,making them thinking you enjoyed them, no i dont want to talk about that
24666, no and also  made strange laughing sounds is maybe the wildest, think of all the money we couldve saved on carrots, yeah theres quite a few
24667,way of saying  laughs, no, dunkey is huge right now
24668, like were justokay not an efficiency of language  i honestly, theres nothing that compares to corn like you cant be like corn, laughs loudly
24669,dont think my other spirits like him very much,and now heres some lettuce now heres a like if you go carrot you can, more of a taz fan
24670,  i just need to be honest about that,go carrot to celery easy, well yeah
24671,  i honestly dont think my other spirits like him very much i just, im sayingokay that was good im saying i think your husband, so you havent heard all the shit hes been talking about these two
24672,need to be honest about that,overreacted laughs,little girls huh
24673,  i gotta get this off my chest yeah he seems like kind of a, huh, well the show was our kid wasnt it
24674,predator i dont really enjoy bumbum and i can see trisha doesnt either, theres a logic puzzle in there right thats like, the three of us got together and made a baby and the baby was
24675, im guessing that if you had time to spend with him and figure out what the, theres a puddle of water on the ground and a man is dead,our show
24676,backstory of the spirit that resides in him is then he probably would settle,laughing what happened, and thats fucking funny like why do you think that thats so
24677,down and act better yeah trisha it sounds like youre taking some pretty, no nooo,funny sydnee
24678,fucking big logical leaps to get this thing out of your house huh, huh, they are yeah
24679, a great friend  at this time i have too many dolls and cannot, would it kill you, sure with a mouth like that
24680,spend enough time with all of them i hear that though i hear that thats, okay, he talks yeah
24681,a toughthats a tough scenario  most of these dolls do not need so much, well well not lethal isnt the same as because i think what, im glad to finally get like a doctors opinion on the fact that
24682,attention but for him to settle down he will need it handle with care,youre also assuming there is a lot of damage will be done but now youve,horses mouths look like they should be talking
24683, and then it has a thing about yknow,figured out you need to roll your window up because then there are other, like i feel that soto my core
24684,  this is fake bullshit,steps down and i feel like maybe if you get blasted in every step of the, laughs
24685,now heres whats up 1750 let me go ahead and crank 20 dollars down,way it compounds the damage, yeah cheering like
24686,on it and you all can tell me when tookay that was not high enough ive, yeah yeah yeah youre definitelyyoure bloodied yknow what i, i wanna fuck your brains out justin stuff like that

25680,it really felt like aa thing like we hadlike it was one of the rarer times,i was like no theyll die im not going to care for those things, yeah and did you also hear how when you gave him your name
25681,where ive taken a secondyknow its hard when you make a podcast uh, no by definition we know,with a little bit of a smile as if he was then gonna be like oh damn justin
25682,every week theres another one to make so you very rarely like, griffin we in fact know who the victim is that is described in the,mcelroy and then there was no recognition at all
25683,thats part of the joke i think with us talking about like favorite bits and,question, and i got a shiver down my spine
25684,favorite episodes or whatever like i dont know we have to do another, now i do have a solution if you are just ate up with guilt and you, laughs loudly
25685,one next week you cant rest on your laurels too much its just youve,need to return this blender but you dont want to do it like face to face or, yeah
25686,gotta do another one,anything that acknowledges your uh that you mindfully took this blender, yeah
25687,so i think that was one of the few moments that i actually took the time to,im going to give you three words brave little toaster, groans i hope so i hope so ooh i hope so but sometimes i
25688,like realize how far we had come and uh how cool it was what we get to,you need to like do a job to make it seem like the blender has escaped your,dont pay very close attention to these dont i
25689,do,house and made it back to the landlords house the landlord that they, ooh cleaning out the closet i like that
25690, yeah,loved so much that maybe its a blender and like a little radio and maybe, oh
25691, wheeze,an electric blanket and a desk lamp and they have made itthey have all, okay
25692, im so sorry,made it back to see the landlord master  which by the way in that show,hey ive got a yahoo here do you wanna hear it
25693, and i still have to tell travis that actually before every episode,they called the guy master its very weird, sent in by jeannette thanks jeannette its yahoo answers
25694, so i guess yknow lets go ahead and call it there this has been, but now the brave little blender has returned uh and hey so,useroh theres anonymous theyre anonymous
25695,a wonderful time of reflection and growth,theres a second brave little toaster movie theres brave little toaster, it was rick asks should the queen move to america to get a new
25696, laughs,goes to mars,experience
25697, yes, it is but theres another sequel to brave little toaster where the, i know
25698, laughs,brave little toaster and friends are able to communicate with animals and, i know so very little about the monarchy or anything really
25699, everybody gets one,now this crosses into a lot of questionable kind of science where i can,government to speak of worldly speaking so this might be coming from
25700, yeah milwaukee yeah,accept that the toaster and the radio and the lamp and the vacuum and the,an uneducated place in fact i can confirm it is but it seems like maybe
25701, that was a crazy show,electric blanket can all talk to each other but now they can also talk to,if the queen came to america she could have a new experience and not
25702, uh yeah this has been a lot of fun and its been fun doing this,monkeys and dogs and cats and like mice and rats and stuff,just came herenot onlynot just came here to visit got a flat you know
25703, this is the end, im just saying its alreadyits hard enough to wrap my mind, lyft oh well i thought you were talking about a rental car but
25704, i kept hoping that jesse would call and say ive changed my,around the fact that cats and dogs and rats and stuff can communicate but,yeah
25705,mind but no hes,now the cats, uh yeah or buggies lorries whatever thatsmaybe yeah
25706, screaming we have to wrap this up, yeah but we finished that and i want to talk about brave little,maybe she starts calling them different shit right

25798,reciprocated it would seem,they sound just as amazing as other top audio brands their newest model,siberian tigers but im extremely here for the idea that the siberian tiger
25799, and support his new interest and hobby on the other hand i like,the everyday e25 ear buds offer six hours of play time seamless bluetooth,big and powerful and beautiful

26450,one mustve felt pretty bad for through laughter everybody to be like i,,like i always see it like in my trending shit on streaming platforms or
26451,dont think we do this anymore actually,,whatever
26452, like the persons in the guillotine and theyre like this feels,, and i dont know why a person would watch one of those at this
26453,unnecessary to me you all agree right,,moment um but why isnt osmosishow has osmosis jones not crept in

26455, a friend and i often work together during class and i wanna ask,,uptight pill friend to like come in and kind of provide maybe even a little
26456,for his number so if i have any questions i can just text him however i,,bit of a howto like a funny joke and animation and loving that but like
26457,dont want him to get the wrong idea and think that im getting his number,,also maybe theres something you can take away there that would be
26458,for any sort of romantic purpose or ulterior motive what is a completely,,helpful at this junction
26459,normal way to ask for someones number without perpetuating the wrong,, its something pretty bad yeah

26502,could be headed to your house immediamente and then the cool thing,,we can safely consider that the during times uh and its dylan and dylan
26503,about that is you get their number and they owe you for the sourdough,,asks  my dad bought the nasty hamburger buns
26504,that you hooked them up with that one time,, so like everybody is suffering from this in their own ways some
26505, yeah,,like much much worse and much more serious than others and we would
26506, travis if you do not have a sourdough starter they will assume you,,encourage you to find ways to support the people out there who really need
26507, through laughter there is fucking no reality in which you cannot,,your help but the good news is that none of those people are on yahoo
26508,also have a sourdough starter on hand ancient grains ready to rip,,answers because
26509, ready to turn that beautiful sugar into carbon dioxide and crank,, dylan says  my dad bought the nasty hamburger buns i hate
26510,that bread up to its maximum fluffy potential,,when he does this

26512, yeah thats kinda thematic,,theres a specific type of buns i like him to buy they are small light buns
26513, id love that,, i like the way hes put in commas here because it says  they are
26514, mmhm,,small comma  light comma  buns comma  these buns are buns
26515, ground beef,,since the burgers are never too big they get smaller when you cook them
26516, yeah,,thats just burger physiology
26517, laughs,,uh  he bought the freaking big dark buns the bun is bigger than the
26518, laughs,,entire patty which means when i bite i will be biting into the bun and its

26946,now nobodys gonna talk about the triplelupa,, laughing
26947,  three shells three flavors,, i dont know if michael dresser is writing about current sort of
26948,  the triplelupa triples the flavor and doubles the beef in taco bells,,pandemic events but i hope he does not apply the same level of frivolity to

26957, groans thats tough   the triplelupa serves a handson,,prime than i cried during the titanic is that okay
26958,experience with three mini chalupas featuring three flavors and double the,, updated two days ago  i didnt really care that much felt it was
26959,seasoned beef compared to the regular chalupa combining three mini,,so stupid wouldve frozen with him lol
26960,chalupas to create the longest shell in taco bell history the triplelupa,, updated again two days ago  but every time i see optimus prime
26961,marks taco bells first ever tearapart menu item it takes all the elements,,die in the cartoon especially i dont care if i saw a kevin hart video prior i
26962,of the chalupa to the next level with different flavors in each of the mini,,lose all control anyone agree
26963,shells nacho do you see how theyve become mini shells,, third update  how he stab optimus prime that like our father
26964, through laughter solely by the fact that theres three of them,, thats true and good and um i yknow i like to cry and i like
26965,joined together now theyre mini shells,,to watch stuff that makes me cry um grays anatomy when sad stuff
26966, its bitesize,,happens on there uh grays is a perfect example cause i could watch ten
26967, theres  nacho cheese on one end chipotle on the other and a,,kevin hart videos before then and it would still
26968,combination of the two cheesy chipotle in the third okay fuck off,, yeah no i would need i would need to go to grays anatomy
26969, through laughter thats notthats not three flavors thats a,,hospital whatever its called to get them to sew up the stitches from the
26970,messy spot in the middle where you cant separate the two,,splits in my belly that i have from watching ten kevin hart videos in a row
26971, yeah trav is it about the triplelupa cause its all i care about,,but then i would cry at the sad drama because yknow a bus would crash
26972, the doublelupa is not on sale right now but it isits just called the,,into the hospital or something and it would cancel out all the kevin hart
26973,double chalupa okay so its twoits double wide basically,,videos
26974, well thats just two of those squished together by a very strong,, okay
26975,man,, cool
26976, um the triokay so the triplelupa getting back into the mix,, this is cool dude its not funny but its likeits likei feel like
26977,here  since the introduction in 1999 the beloved menu item has,,im at like a fuckin cool movie
26978,continuously transformed in shape form and ingredients to become the,, no i know we dont do like badass stuff on this podcast enough
26979,most reinvented taco bell menu item of all time weird brag,,so like lets not do dont do anymore jokes travis please tell me
26980,  all our fans agree: we cant get this one right,, actually stop stop start at the beginning of the movie shot one
26981,  from flavor innovation like the baja chalupa in 2000,,what are we looking at here
26982,   to size innovation with the double chalupa in 2017 we were so,, do we get to know that the titanic is a transformer before this
26983,close,,happens or what
26984, quote  at taco bell we recognize and love the fandom that the,, so its basically the same movie right up until the fateful collision
26985,chalupa has cultivated over the years,,that one dark cold night
26986, a fandom that is devoted to essentially a concept really a brand,, okay
26987,name really cause this thing has been reinvented so many times thats,, alright
26988,why we wanna bring our fans,, i dont like it anymore
26989, fan favorite probably there is  its an all new flavor and shell,, its not gonna come back around
26990,experience with the triplelupa thats from kristine futalan associate,, stop its not its done
26991,manager of research and development at taco bell and lead product,, ohh hold on im comin back

26994,transformation of this beloved menu item and we cant wait for everyone to,, and let me getlet me hit you with this travis if you dont mind
26995,taste this latest innovation,,we can bring in sort of the uh the dino sort of aesthetic from that and it
26996,  for the triplelupas nationwide debut i wanna thank taco bell,,can be calledand the iceberg decepticon can be called gynobot and he is
26997,honestly kidding aside,,a dinosaur
26998, and this one is so long and theres no way they couldve known,, but hes gonna help open up the cargo bay i guess which would
26999,and they made such a long press release for this thank you,,be like the yknow the fallopian canal iits been a while since i brushed
27000, for the triplelupas nationwide debut taco bell is partnering with a brand,,up on that stuff laughing
27001,known for serving up its own reinventions guess right now both of you,, but uh okay
27002,guess,, i dont want voltroni dont want voltron there we gotyou cant
27003, laughs a brand,,cross it
27004, well its tiktok,, i know voltrons a trained doula travis
27005,  the shortform mobile video platform serves as the framework for,, i know
27006,the triplelupas national tv spot and is the first time tiktok has partnered,, i think thats cool and then after that fight wait do they keep
27007,with a brand on a national advertising campaign shot in tiktoks full screen,,fighting after the birth
27008,vertical video format the ad spot follows the creative unexpected and joyful,, right
27009,content the tiktok community is celebrated for which i would assume is,, then they keep fighting i assume transformer wins
27010,much less triplelupa focused now than it wouldve been two weeks ago,, okay
27011, when i look back at our history with social trends im proud of the fact,, and then do we see the ship continue its journey on for another
27012,that we are always leading the industry and pushing boundaries whether,,couple hours until it docks in america safely
27013,its being the first on new platforms or breaking records on others taco bell,, alright
27014,is constantly at the forefront of online trends said tracee larocca senior,, are there a lot more

27016,at the moment,, is there more porkin then in the back half of the movie
27017,  the most laughs  the most natural step for us would be to,, okay
27018,partner with a brand like tiktok,, thats not what i want
27019,  the most natural step for our taco store ,, is there one where voltron and billy zane
27020,   would be part howherewhere did it gohow did it get to,, i want voltron and billy zane to figure out how that would work
27021,here where  the most natural step for our taco store is to partner with,,even

29747,than this together,,punch man thank you uh or wait thats who asked it i dont want to
29748, tonight while preparing dinner my husband said we had too many,,thank them because they do ask  are hippos stabproof
29749,veggies so he wasnt gonna cook carrots i said fine by me i dont really,,  i heard that hippos are close to bulletproof so they could certainly
29750,like carrots this shocked him far more than i was expecting he said he felt,,shrug off a sword attack by a human right
29751,betrayed and that i shouldve mentioned this at some point in our six year,, yeah
29752,relationship before now,, i dont want to celebrate the idea of hurting uh a beautiful
29753,the thing is i dont hate carrots and usually i eat them without complaint,,hippopotamus um but i do enjoy the fact that they are apparently they
29754,because theyre healthy theyre just not my favorite vegetable should i,,cant be killed with uh bullets theres almost like alike a
29755,have mentioned this beforehand should i now sit down and come up with a,, almost
29756,list of things im just not a huge fan of or impartial to just in case or is he,, how have we measured that i wonder
29757,overreacting thats from just not that enthused in australia,, laughs or it
29758,what a fucking great question i only want to talk about this,, or just a very unethical scientist lined up five hippos shot five of
29759, i just think its got everything that i like to talk about now,,them and two died and they were like  well damn im gonna call it
29760, relationships maintaining a long term relationship and vegetables,,thats prettythats more bulletproof than us humans are
29761,and where they are sort of at where im at can i talk about my journey,, so a sword attack hippos are dangerous right like hippo
29762,with carrots its just that kind of an inverse of cheese,, i do not want to step inyeah i dont want to
29763, if you cook carrots im so out if you have em raw ill eat those,, um yeah theyyeah and sooo i would argue youre not
29764,crunchy little bastards all day long you cook it im completely out on,,gonna be able to get in there like you could have a lot of like incredible
29765,carrot i dont want to eat it anymore,,sword technique youve been studying the blade and the block chain while
29766, its the mushy and the sweetness the mushy sweetness that i,,the rest of us were partying but i do think you get within a certain distance
29767,really dont enjoy,,of aof one of these big powerful beasts and like youre just gonna
29768, there is almost no vegetable im sitting here trying to think of it,,that part of your brain the sword fighting part of your brain is just gonna
29769,theres almost no vegetable that i fuck with equally,,like be completely overwhelmed by the part that makes you shit your pants
29770,  in a hot versus a cold i mean like right like raw carrots,,and fall down because of this huge beast
29771,down raw celery better than cooked celery basically,,  oh no i should stay away i think in most situations  and
29772, cauliflower fucking keep it,,maybe this is why hippos are dangerous is that they just always have the
29773, i dont fuck with raw tomatoes,,thought in their mind of like  i got this im so big
29774, okay,, yeah
29775, laughs,, um apparently hippo skin is very thick and quote  resistant to
29776, well somebody wants some stringy garbage in between their,,puncture so i guess it does come down to the sort of like sharpness
29777,incisors great,, no were gonna keep talking about this

30320, now trav you said youve baked six loaves of bread and you still,,
30321,have to look at the recipe,,
30322, if a surgeon told me  this is the sixth one of these ive done i,,
30323,dont need to look at anything that wouldnt fill me,,
30324, six is not like a lot if you think about it,,
30325, thats why they have the fuckin ear piece in,,
30326, you never noticed that they got a ear piece every surgeon has,,
30327,and then they got atheres a boss surgeon telling them the different,,
30328,things they have to do and occasionally ribbled jokes,,
30329, when the mood is dour,,
30330, laughs dr pippin,,
30331, laughing,,

30341,how to take out a gall bladder and its like  well i sure as fuck knew,,
30342,better than like you wouldve done it at home like its definitely better,,
30343,than that i did a better job than you wouldve done,,
30344, sure i guess,,
30345, no but,,
30346, i want to talk about this,,
30347, the first timei think basically the way it works is like this you,,
30348,have a big doctor and theres a little doctor,,
30349, and at first the little doctor is like standing on the big doctors,,
30350,feet and the big doctor is holding their hands and doing all the cutting for,,
30351,them right,,
30352, and then they keep doing surgery after surgery and then um then,,
30353,just one time they like look behind them and they realize that the big,,
30354,doctor is now um in the bathroom,,
30355, they slipped away in the night,,
30356, youre the doctor now they were never alive they were actually a,,
30357,ghost,,
30358, in this one in this one they were a ghost but like thats a basic,,
30359,idea,,
30360, its basically like a like the bicycle like learning to ride a bike,,
30361,like the big doctor is holding your waist and then you are doing the entire,,
30362,surgery and realize like they let go already and youre just like still doing,,
30363,it,,
30364, oh my god,,
30365, sure,,
30366, listen were not doctors we have to make our money the honest,,
30367,way around here we cant rely on big podcasters,,
30368, okay thats interesting oh you handed me a business card here,,
30369,yep thats what it says podcast doctor thats a little bizarre,,
30370, yes,,

30395,within a podcast,,
30396, within a pocket this is uh throwback munch squad which is a,,
30397,podcast miniseries within a podcast within a podcast uh where we talk,,
30398,about the real latest because they are uh theyre very old theyre very,,
30399,old ads cause no one is making new food anymore and the ones that are,,
30400,are depressing and not funny anymore they used to be funny,,
30401,fast food chains kids dont remember but fast food chains used to do silly,,
30402,things and now they just do boring things like if i go to one of my old,,
30403,sources heres one of the headers  brusters real ice cream adds sweet and,,
30404,salty treats to menus right that seems fine,,
30405,very first sentence of this press release is  with the effects of coronavirus,,
30406,covid19 still top of mind creating new routines and traditions can be,,
30407,restorative hey are you just selling ice cream or cause i think you need,,
30408,to calm down im trying to have fun over here with the munch squad,,
30409, so we are gonna head on back get in the way back machine april,,
30410,16th 2001 this is from oliver and i very much appreciate it  arbys has,,
30411,appetite for adults,,
30412, this onethis is maybe the sexist munch squad weve ever done,,
30413,so hang in there with me  with its adult positioning now established,,
30414,arbys is testing an advertising approach designed for mature audiences,,
30415,  the quick service chain is once again tapping the star power of,,
30416,rb crooner barry white,,
30417,  only this time as a new character that the company refers to as,,
30418,appetite man,,
30419,  aimed at touting the crave appeal of the chains menu arbys,,
30420,created  see these days we say cravability thats how far weve come in,,
30421,these 19 years  arbys created a character it thought would represent how,,
30422,passionate seductive and discriminating a persons appetite might be,,
30423,i know what youre saying is this the same person thats driving into,,
30424,arbys and the answer is yes it is  the appetite urges you to act on your,,
30425,real desires and not settle for ordinary fast food because your appetite,,
30426,wants the best,,
30427,they dont finish the sentence but im assuming it ends with thing that is,,
30428,available at arbys the best thing that they have on the menu of arbys,,
30429, so what better personification of what the company refers to as quote,,
30430,passion love and seduction than mr white the singer was also a natural,,
30431,choice since the company already had good results using him in its 99,,
30432,campaign,,
30433,this is fucking so wild that someones like three years after the fact like,,
30434, can we try barry white again and this time well call him appetite man,,
30435,and that person got promoted,,
30436, actually in this specific situation i have uh the onlythey,,
30437,describe what the ads theyre making for test markets are right,,
30438, and these are theres only one actual ad that they made with,,
30439,appetite man that i could actually find,,
30440, so were gonna take 30 seconds to listen to that and then im,,
30441,gonna describe the other wild ones that they had in store so heres this,,
30442,first,,
30443,arbys ad plays,,
30444, five is,,
30445, hey barry five is so many,,
30446, and there is no point in that commercial where hes like  and share,,
30447,them with a friend like its just for me i think to eat these five,,
30448,sandwiches,,
30449,  in the commercials the soul singer invades peoples lives with the,,
30450,pavlovian timing to personify their hunger pangs first as a voice then,,
30451,appearing in miniature in the amazed persons stomach this is so fucking,,
30452,unfair that i dont have theits so,,
30453, quote  theres a little barry in all of us says scott lippett exec,,
30454,vp group account director on arbys  in one spot a man is driving his wife,,
30455,obviously in labor to the hospital,,
30456,  suddenly he hears mr white say hey baby were in the mood,,
30457,for something tasty,,
30458,  the expectant father looks down at his stomach and sees mr,,
30459,white who says this is your appetite baby you gotta give into love,,
30460,  the dad to be now asks but do we have time the appetite man,,
30461,has the answer drivethrough the spot closes with the wife driving while,,
30462,the husband eats,,
30463, do you know how wild it is that in this spot there is a man whose,,
30464,wife is in the passengers seat with a small baby in her stomach and then,,
30465,this man discovers that a small barry white lives in his stomach,,
30466, its barry white i bet its barry white in a diaper just like a big,,
30467,baby barry white,,
30468, a second effort takes a direct shot at mcdonalds,,
30469, where mr white asks which is very good mr white asks  hey,,
30470,baby why you eatin that clown food,,
30471, get em,,
30472, so uh appetite man isis a campaign that im guessing they just,,
30473,chickened out on cause everythings on youtube and this is not so uh,,
30474,that seems unfair to me personally so i dont think they ever actually went,,
30475,through with it,,
30476, sure bud im happy to  with its adult positioning now,,
30477,established,,
30478, oh actually lets drill down on this for a second laughs,,
30479,  with its adult positioning now established arbys is testing an,,
30480,advertising approach designed for mature audiences so what what is,,
30481,happening are you saying that adults love it so much that were just gonna,,
30482,make sexy ads for adults now is that the way it works,,
30483, thats kidthats a threequarter pound pile of meat thats just for,,
30484,kids,,
30485, thats kid stuff,,
30486, laughing,,
30487, my fiveyearold nephew gorphus loves jamocha shakes,,
30488, they put em around their fingers thats why they make em curly,,
30489,so fucking kids can do that,,
30490, i want adult food for a man,,
30491, i have horny adult food cravings and arbys with its thin slices of,,
30492,meat cant satisfy it,,
30493, fuckin mozz sticks they might as well be pacifiers for babies,,
30494,cause im an adult and i dont eat that kind of shit,,
30495, well hold on now now hold on if my favorite singer laughs if,,
30496,my favorite singer in 2001 barry white likes arbys maybe he wouldnt,,
30497,throw in with some fuckin kid food,,
30498, this is food for grown adults,,
30499, as barry white  there are lots of places to fuck this sandwich,,
30500,look at it,,
30501,  put it anywhere,,
30502,  listen when you stack up this many slices of deli  laughs,,

30579,an advice show for the modern era im your oldest brother justin mcelroy,,
30580, folks these problems dont seem to be real until they affect,,
30581,someone that you care about and then its time to really sound the alarm,,
30582,bells and get out there,,
30583, no sooner had we pretty much wrapped up the coronavirus thing,,
30584,at this point,,
30585, wereits wrapping up this is likewere in the credits sequence,,
30586,for sure,,
30587, just as coronavirus finally gets wrapped up now our family our,,
30588,family has been stricken with uh well just one member of our family uh,,
30589,has been stricken with a case of scoob fever,,
30590, mmm,,
30591, oh wow,,
30592, you may have actually vaccinated yourself with an inert uh,,
30593, some of the inert virus and then made the antibodies,,
30594, mmm,,
30595, laughs,,
30596, um i cant,,
30597, once and for all laughing,,
30598, um i cant we cant really talk about our feelings about the scoob,,
30599,film because our careers have taken so many twists at this point that i,,
30600,have a not insignificant statistical chance of being in a room with people,,
30601,that worked on this film,,
30602, at this point so i cant actually talk that much about it,,
30603, but i will say one thing in the movie that is is that we meet the,,
30604,gang when theyre kids and when um shaggy adopts scooby he gives,,
30605,him um a collar with the sd on it and he saysscooby says  ill never,,
30606,take it off scoobys talking a lot in this one by the way im not loving it,,
30607, but he swears hell never take it off there is a plot point another,,
30608,hour into the film which is ten years later uh where much is made much,,
30609,ballyhoo is made of the fact that scoob is in fact taking off the collar for the,,
30610,first time hey shaggy um i dont think thats okay laughs,,
30611, just from a hygiene standpoint i dont think thats great dog,,
30612,maintenance i would say,,
30613, get in there,,
30614, stellar cast is that what youre about to ask,,
30615, the cast is fucking stellar,,
30616, oh there goes my quiz show that i was about to do with you,,
30617,travis let me ball it up and put it in the trash,,
30618, yeah,,
30619, travis if i was to tell you that the action of the film the impetus,,
30620,of the action of the film is that simon cowell wants to invest in mystery,,
30621,inc but not if shaggy and scooby are attached then you would think i,,
30622,am kidding you but no that is the actual impetus of the action in the film,,
30623,they are looking to take on investors,,
30624, simon cowell is interested but does not trust scooby and shaggy,,
30625, hey lets talk about,,
30626, of theokay travis one more thing i will say,,
30627, of the mystery inc gang,,
30628, which one do you think gets trapped in literal hell sacrificing his,,
30629,soul for all eternity in this film,,
30630, who makes the decision to sacrifice their soul for all eternity,,
30631, mmhmm so go on,,
30632, interesting i cant answer that but heres what i will say  its not,,
30633,scooby and the problem i have with that is as sydneeone of the gang,,
30634,does this act of locking themselves in hell forever so scooby doesnt have to,,
30635,and as sydnee pointed out so astutely as we watched the film laughing,,
30636,scooby is ten years old at this point,,
30637, laughing so it isand the gang is in their like late teens,,
30638, i mean thats grim but come on folks,,
30639, you hate to talk about it uh alright lets move on,,
30640,  hello brothers,,
30641,  ive gotten into beekeeping and id love to spread the word about,,
30642,saving these lovely ladies and what people can do to help the problem is,,
30643,im often patronized and called cute and adorable when i tell my new,,

30741,resembled a beach towel my family used to own i cant get it out of my,,
30742,head that its the same towel is there any way i can try to reclaim the,,
30743,towel or even ask about the towel without sounding like a towelobsessed,,
30744,creep maybe she stole it from me when we were ten or maybe her mom,,
30745,got it at costco or whatever but its a good towel and i want it back and if,,
30746,she did steal it is there an expiration date on towel theft,,
30747,i think they probably dont mean expiration date thats not the legal term i,,
30748,think,,
30749, statute of limitations,,
30750, beach towel burgled in bc british columbia ummm,,
30751, beautiful country up there,,
30752, yeah i would say one step too far is the literal first step you,,
30753,might take in trying to retrieve this towel that you think your family used to,,
30754,own,,
30755, yeah that was my fear as well,,
30756, laughs,,

30934,way to remember that there was one point when people had i think we will,,
30935,all agree too much money yknow what i mean,,
30936, like they just had too much money so this kind of fixed that a,,
30937,little bit made them have less yknow what i mean,,

30939,okay,,
30940, okay okay,,
30941, yeah,,
30942, almost,,
30943, laughs,,

30957, when i was in third grade my school held a writing competition i,,
30958,submitted a story and it was one of the winners i got a five dollar,,
30959,mcdonalds gift card and that was the last i thought of it until recently,,
30960,when my old elementary school announced that theyd be releasing a book,,
30961,of all the stories that had won the competition as a way to look fondly on,,
30962,prequarantine times the problem is i plagiarized my story from an,,
30963,encyclopedia brown book,,
30964,  i changed the names of the characters but it was still otherwise,,
30965,exactly the same third grade me ,,
30966,  was reckless and thought of nothing of the consequences but,,
30967,now im afraid the story will be released and everybody will see what a,,
30968,fraud i am how do i stop my story from being released without raising,,
30969,suspicion thats from plagiarist in pennsylvania,,
30970, im gonna see if donald j sobol is still alive,,
30971, hey great news donald j sobol is dead no wait eight years ago,,

31017, laughing,,
31018, im ready,,
31019, whoa okay,,
31020, okay,,
31021, first i have two complicating factors of this,,
31022, the first is that uhh i hate to rename the tour this late into the,,
31023,year,,
31024, tickets,,
31025, just hate to rename it laughs this point,,
31026, for sure for sure thats huge uh uh number two is do you,,
31027,remember when all the beeznesses had to shut down and a lot of them are,,
31028,still shut down thats tonally for me bumping,,
31029, you wont,,
31030, mmm,,
31031, youve complicatedyouve complicated this because bees i,,
31032,think at some points it would be beneficial for them to rest on laurels just,,
31033,so the various pollination things that need to happen,,
31034, do you know what i mean like resting on laurels occasionally for,,
31035,them is probably essential so they probably do rest on laurels,,
31036, thats absolutely wild travis the thing youve said to me that,,
31037,theyre minding their own business is absolutely wild these monstrous,,
31038,things are flying around fucking plants and stinging toddlers every single,,
31039,day it is what they are known for theyre making movies about it they,,
31040,crave it they crave interaction with us,,
31041, they love interfacing with humans so much they made their jizz,,
31042,taste good come on now,,

31059, um and weand two of you say  lets change it is that just it,,
31060,is it a majority vote or is this like,,
31061, cause it does raise the question if we have the ability to do this it,,
31062,does raise the question of 2016 we had a cherry seven weeks there at the,,
31063,tail end where we couldve been like  listen these bridges aint gettin,,
31064,built,,
31065,  no twenty fixteen were changing it to twenty sucksteen,,

31068, i will grant you this the speed at which things seem to be moving,,
31069, currently,,
31070, does make the idea that we could sort of encapsulate 12 months,,
31071,of existence on this particular plane,,
31072, unthinkable,,

31333,internal services  were proud to be the home of the first and only booster,,
31334,juice fit and fun zone in the world,,
31335, the thing that is so fucking wild to me about this there is no bit,,
31336,there is no store at the airport that needs to like broadcast its marketing,,
31337,message more than a 30foot radius around itself right am i gonna go to,,
31338,that booster juice or no ill just go get a fuckin coke at burger king,,
31339,because its actually five steps closer cause im at the airport and i dont,,
31340,give a shit,,
31341,so heres some game descriptions,,
31342,  the motion game immerses players in an intense and cinematic,,
31343,world enabling players to use their body for the hyperrealistic dynamic and,,
31344,interactive environments booster juice surf places the cool you in board,,
31345,shorts riding ,,
31346, what is this fucking like meme garbage nonsense someone is,,
31347,shit posting in the middle of this press release  booster juice surf places,,
31348,the cool you thats in quotes  cool you in board shorts riding a branded,,
31349,surf board in the center of a giant wave,,
31350,  points accumulate as you avoid dolphins and buoys while trying to,,
31351,keep your balance,,
31352,  juice bar jumper is a 2d running style game and closely,,
31353,resembles the recognizable booster juice stores what the fuck,,
31354, this gets so wild yall  with incredibly cute illustrations and a,,
31355,suspenseful storyline a strawberry speedily whisks across countertops,,
31356,earning extra points upon collecting yummy blueberries as time passes the,,
31357,difficulty increases,,
31358, i fuckin heard that,,
31359,  in another 2d game that same superstar character  a strawberry,,
31360,with a dashing smile  rides a booster juice cup like a rocket with fruits,,
31361,firing out instead of flames he flies through the skies avoiding evil candy,,
31362,collecting tasty fruit and racking up the points,,
31363, im not making this next part up,,
31364,  the third game unravels a darker more riveting plot involving the,,
31365,destiny of the strawberry,,
31366,  this is a uniquely styled intense game with challenges above and,,
31367,below laughing,,
31368, in fuckin heaven and hell i guess it means,,
31369,  with challenges above and below where the player has to double,,
31370,tap to slip in between terrifying blenders in these vibrantly drawn worlds,,
31371,players must use a variety of skills to survive and gain points,,
31372, this reads like the person writing it was being told about the,,
31373,existence of video games via telegraph through time travel like they were,,
31374,just getting bleeps and bloops of a portal opening and closing,,
31375, additional games were also designed to challenge your mind these puzzles,,
31376,are formulated to make you think as you match fruit and test your reflexes,,
31377,certainly the gameplay experience is enhanced while sipping one of booster,,
31378,juices delicious smoothies,,
31379, yeah so anyway,,
31380, 2016 it may still be there,,
31381, yeah id love that griff,,
31382, is a snail a slug,,
31383, no,,
31384, i feel,,
31385, i feel like theyre different i feel like snails have little suction cups,,
31386,at the bottom of them and slugs dont that is mythat is my,,
31387, and i think that theyre probably very closely related and i bet if,,
31388,a slug sees a snail hes like  aw shit that looks nice,,
31389,  that fuckin looks nice id love that when salt starts pouring down,,
31390,on me,,
31391, uh obviously,,
31392, yeah but when the salt starts flyin,,
31393, who looks like a smart aleck now,,
31394, hmm,,
31395, yeah,,
31396, who brought the first shell,,
31397, of course,,
31398, i wish there was some way to find this information,,
31399, its soits so hard,,
31400, no youre not getgoodont search this i dont want the,,
31401,answer,,

31403,youre sitting at home like  oh im getting so mad i know this dont tell,,
31404,me i dont want to know i want to live in ignorance about this one,,
31405,let me have this little bit of magic alright please,,

31407, do you rent them at the shell store and then you keep them as,,
31408,long as you want,,
31409, and then once theyre worn out you take them back in and get a,,
31410,brand new shell,,
31411, no that implies that they could own them at a certain point,,
31412, what is the difference between renting and leasing i actually dont,,
31413,know this dont tell me,,
