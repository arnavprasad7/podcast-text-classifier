104,over there trash,i thought you would want this, unless hes the kind of kid who would do that
105, notorious food thieves the harlem globetrotters, i dont know the box was full, thats good

108,one you can find and then just keep throwing their things into it im, it was a good turkey hand, oh my god yeah i am like the harlem globetrotters just like
109,making its a debt that im building against my future self but its not, mmhmm,taking a little chunk of meatloaf off henrys plate and like twirling it around
110,current my problem its my future problem, a real joke that threeyearold travis told,his head so he gets dizzy and hes like wait what wheres it oh its
111, what if you had peaked then theres no way to know, i know,gone okay who cares
112, yeah, yes,and im like laughs heh heh i care i care about the delicious trader

114,dad said whos there,you know when i was three, laughs uh do you guys wanna yahoo
115,and travis said knife, yeah, okay but he brought you a box of three percent of your first grade
116, and dad said knife who, i know yes,bullshit
117,and travis said would you rather work nightly or knifely, yes, i like travis old shit
118, laughs its so good, i remember that and i also remember and i dont know why they, i like like uh turkey hand
119, its a really excellent it subverts its an excellent joke that im,didnt credit it as based off a true story like it originally said on the, oh man man ever since turkey hand its all been so fucking
120,still laughing about to this day,manuscript when i wrote it of like this is my life,downhill like a lot of stuff was derivative of turkey hand and these days
121, i memorized it verbatim its such an excellent joke, mmhmm,its just like at our live shows travis busts out turkey hand and its like
122, remember when you wrote the treatment for hancock, yes,oh god man
123, and you sold it and it sat on the blacklist for 20 years but you, hmm, and thats all and youve never done anything that good on this
124,made like a ton of fucking cash, not funny,show trav
125, heres what im saying the elephant never forgets, i think that what if in elephant heaven everything was scaled to, and do you remember when that car was gonna hit me and you
126, and the elephant will be in heaven for eternity so a hea,their size,lifted it up from the back of the wheels of it like hancock when you were
127,elephant in heaven is simultaneously living the entirety of existence as it, cause like right now if an elephant tried to go into an office,five
128,understands it at all times not only is there an eternity ahead of it there,building it would just be a fiasco right the hallways would be too narrow, and thats it like you peaked you were so and do you
129,is an eternity of moments that are in its past that are inescapable,the doors are too small,remember how fucking cut and handsome you were at five
130, right think about that for a second it never forgets, but this is like a world in which the elephant can get in an elevator, and now you are like just a shambling mess of bones and skin
131, i think elephant heaven is the ability to forget thats all im,you know what i mean and then, i got my oil changed and the place that i get my oil changed at i
132,saying is like they just wanna be able to forget something, no no one makes that joke cause its fucking heaven griffin for,started to sit down in like the hangout area where you wait for your car to
133, awesome,elephants no ones making,be healthy and ready for you again
134, thick clouds, they go to hell, and they did have a tv that was showing hancock and it
135, if you die when youre an elephant you die in real life did you, okay,mystified me that that was the choice that they had made for film to watch
136,know that, welcome to heaven,in 2019 in their waiting room so i called a lyft and i came home where
137, laughs,wait what did you say gasps oh,there was no hancock do you want a yahoo
138, is that thomas edisons hell or heaven, well uh, heres a yahoo that was sent in by emma kant thank you emma
139, his groin just reforms and hes ready for another rumba if you, laughs,its yahoo answers user cuddle punch who asks what would a heaven for
140,know what i mean, adamantium,elephants be like
141, i think we all could i mean were gonna be up there for a while, he nasty, what would a heaven for elephants be like lets get this out of
142,theres time for everything, well on earth,the way peanuts not funny next answer
143, we can get over there and stomp on his balls no problem, do you think that if youre an elephant and youre sick or getting a, not funny
144, laughs,little old and you suddenly realize that youve just walked to the elephant, huh
145, laughs crap heres another question,graveyard do you think youre like oh damn it and then you die, oh it would be a mess itd be a mess yeah
146,i had a party at my house tonight and everyone is left except two people, laughs i shouldnt have come think about that like if every, an elephator
147,now im laying on the floor waiting for these two people to leave so i can,time a human being was about to die and we just found ourselves walking, oh theres probably some elephants that would find that pretty
148,go to bed they said they need some time to sober up which is,towards a cemetery and youre just like ah well,funny
149,understandable we dont want people to drive drunk but they both just, i guess this is it, huh yeah
150,opened another drink how do i get them to leave thats from drowsy in, im going this way for some reason oh bummer wish i could, so probably they would need some way to rectify that i imagine
151,denver,turn around but uh guess im, oh tight
152, you can just go to bed cant he cant he just go to bed just go, laughs, ill tell you one thing that i know for certain about elephant
153,to sleep, is it always thomas edison,heaven and its that the clouds have to be extremely thick
154, thank you yes, okay are they all going to be inventors, very very very thick clouds or else these bad boys are just
155, i can listen to that i could hear that track about five times, laughs,gonna falling noise right through em because of their considerable
156, before it even started to irritate me though, and whats great about that song is not only is it direct and to the,weight thick thick clouds
157, i think i would be into it for about 15 minutes,point like hey its closing time but it is of such a quality that the more it, you know what would be cool is if when you die when youre an
158, its a good fucking track though,is repeated the harder it becomes to listen to,elephant which is the saddest thing i can imagine but then youre up and
159, oh thats good that would get me to leave any room,like the first time you hear it you get this like nostalgic like oh closing,elephant
160, i would leave a room where rufus from bill  ted was reading,time and then the second time youre like oh its closing time and, i think you get walked into the well it wouldnt be pearl cause i
161,winning lotto numbers if it was playing a tv show that i had not seen in the,then by like the third fourth fifth time youre like i have to get out of,think thats a little too close to ivory itd be made out of some badass shit
162,middle of the series hands down no matter if its im out,here,that elephants like
163, no intent to watch it doesnt matter, like it is an effective tool as well as being a direct message, but elephant saint peter or saint peanut is like oh right this
164, might never watch it, yeah,way and ill lead you into elephant heaven and on the way in you have to
165, laughs they have good performances, no way,go through the border here and the border is um is just thomas edison

339, would you do themeing, oh that thats my really terrible humidifier,and then you bring it up to your mouth and you know tuck into it there
340, like remember the popcorn shovel that people used to use, or maybe one of their roommates is like a real food experimenter,and this is like a halfway point between justins sort of monstrous wild

491, but metaphorically speaking,or cause i broke into her house to eat her leftover lasagna,its fax for caleb fax
492, laughs, and also shes not my aunt shes just a stranger, all right caleb asks what should i do if random bread appeared
493, id love that, whats the big deal youre welcome i didnt dirty your utensils,in my bird feeder
494, caleb fax, now open the safe,some bread appeared in my bird feeder outside it might not sound weird
495, that sounds like a kids like something youd see on a placemat, the problem is is if you dont eat with your hands how do you,but i live in the forest so its creepy af none of my family members so it
496,hey im caleb facts did you know clouds are made of rain,shuffle the lasagna together and make one big stack stacking noises and, hey yall im scrolling through all of the responses to this
497,audience laughs,then you have doubleslice lasagna,question theres not one thats like do you mean a small piece of bread
498, its true, and then you unhinge your jaw,caleb so i dont know who the fuck calebs talking to with his
499, im caleb facts we have mac and cheese and grilled cheese, and you eat it in one bite, its first of all when its in the forest the whole forest is a bird
500, what are they hiding, yes,feeder
501, we also have grapes, yes hey what do you use the spoon for, bring us your sticks and vomit and we will make you a home
502, thats a good point we have systems in place for this, in the consumption process of lasagna wheres the spoon come, laughs
503, uh it is obvious to me what has happened here the birds are now,into play, teach us of the toilet
504,taking care of caleb, hows the service, we all know birds are just jealous
505,groundchild, laughs, another option is that laughs theyre hoping that youre gonna
506, you have fed and nurtured us for long enough groundchild we, i mean i do,come out one day and be like do i put bread in the bird feeder i guess i
507,now shall sustain you, but i dont have to,do
508, sup of this bread groundchild and let it be known there is, youre 35 derek stop coming over and eating my lasagna,and theyre like yes it fucking worked i told you that this was gonna
509,peace between the skypeople and the groundchildren our war has, soup laughs sarcastically,fucking work
510,ended, because heres the problem heres what ive just realized, all right sound pretty lively to me uh yowzers this first hit me
511, eat no more of the flesh of the chicken let it be known the skypeople and groundchildren have made peace, the problem with eating lasagna with your hands is lasagna is a,as my mom has a butterfly pinned to some corkboard which is some
512, caleb spread the word to the other groundchildren,tray bake so either at some point a utensil was used or you grabbed a,peoples thing and thats cool thats fine but its not because your
513, the skypeople seek war no more sup of this grain caleb,mitt full of fucking noodles and sauce and cheese and shit,mothers putting it on plants and thats the wildest shit ever
514, we shall teach you the ways of the skies caleb come be a windmaster with us, but then you can make an argument of like i didnt want to dirty, thats favoritism is what that is
515, let us bring down the raccoons caleb let their jests and japes,a utensil you already did, any other thing ever
516,no more echo through the forest caleb, well if youre gonna use the spatula just keep using the spatula, oh shit
517, yeah we have seen the bow and arrow that your sister katie,its just a big spoon if you think about it a big flat spoon, what strikes me is when i beef it im pretty sure ill turn into
518,has let us rid ourselves of the raccoons, i also just realized that the context of your question is if this,bones what happens to a butterfly after it beefs it has it got bones
519, open thine abode let peace be made,exact scenario happens again,probably not what were you gonna say justin
520, laughs, what do i do at which point i dont know maybe write a, laughs
521, place your shame on the toilet like us caleb um,book about your life and how you got to this point what choices youve, laughs
522, laughs thats a good idea why have i been wasting so much,made, around this house you better stay caterpillars
523,money on bird seed they probably hate these seeds laughs, tickle check, good
524,my mom has been carrying around a dead butterfly for years literal years, tickle check and then you could go armpits and if they laugh, laughs
525,and it has even moved through two different houses its lived on different,say like okay, sure
526,live plants and insists that it is okay behavior now this person didnt, all right tickle check is out, travis you have five seconds come up with a lie
527,reiterate that that was their mom but im assuming its not the dead, now open your mouth and catch this shrimp good job, yeah thats a pretty good lie
528,butterfly insisting that it is okay behavior but how should i handle, laughs, here is another yahoo this one was sent in by michael thanks

532, what if god was one of us maybe were the aliens uh,were steven he knows what he did and then maybe as you walk by just, is it unacceptable to eat lasagna with your hands at home at
533, we inherited a lot of decorations from sydnees grandparents but a,lean in and whisper i got the tag,home
534,lot of them werent their decorations its like stuff that had been left at, now what, not at a restaurant at home i was eating lasagna with my
535,their house by their kids and a lot of things in our house we have no earthly, now poke holes in that rocksolid logic,hands in my aunts house so not your fucking home but okay this is
536,idea of where it came from, i also shop at hm,how i eat when im in my own house i never use utensils but in the
537, yes exactly so in our bathroom there is a corkboard with a glass, yeah let me check,restaurant i do use fork and spoon
538,frame thing and theres like 10 butterflies stuck to it and not like, yeah i was just let me check the clock oh yeah its joke time,audience laughs
539, certainly this semantic distinction is worth doing here on stage,i was just making jokes, yeah
540, but not three weeks ago charlie was brushing her teeth and she, let me try again you punch him in the armpit, like an arcade claw machine just like
541,looked at me and shes like sorry sorry to brag my kid brushes her, that actually blows it on the spot and also youre robbing him,audience laughs
542,teeth dad of the year over here she was brushing her teeth she said,maybe just start loudly discussing with your you said husband i believe, my aunt saw me and got mad at me and was like is that how
543,dad whats that,start loudly discussing with your husband how cool it is when people have,you eat in the restaurant use your fork when technically i wasnt even in
544,and i said um its a bunch of dead butterflies,armpit tags aw yeah people when they leave the price tags in their,the restaurant and i was in her house did i only further infuriate her
545,and she said why do we have that,armpit isnt that the coolest,because i just showed up at her house as an unexpected visitor
546,and i had to answer honestly and say i dont know honey its just,and okay now this is gonna take some prediscussion for your husband to,audience laughs

551,butterflies on the wall, oh maybe wait how mini is a mini corgi, shes not my aunt shes my stranger
552,its as if we hung it there there is an implication of saying like this is, oh not small enough to put in your pocket, yeah good point

1117,but one of my coworkers who couldnt come dropped what i believe to be,my painting, i just i spit oh my god
1118,some backhanded advice later that afternoon he said my birthdays, first of all i would like to address the first sentence and maybe, i am so far away from my computer monitor when i record
1119,coming up soon too about a week out i start letting people know about it,its just i havent worked enough internships but i have never heard it been,mbmbam and i got a lot of spit on it from that vitamin cheese

1121,provoke the attention it brings i never liked having to do that but he,enough, okay okay
1122,brings up a good point how do i let people know about my birthday coming, uh, no im back im back im back

1124, so they can go to lunch with us and not sound like a narcissist, ask your boss do you mind if i move this lamp, w
1125,and thats from its all about me in tennessee, yeah you leave that what now listen this is risky cause if, this is the wil why are they doing this for this why do they care

1127, you need a middle person you need to have someone who is uh,and you say my home the jig is up laughs, its the 70th
1128,following all your dark machinations and someone who will get the word, yes, its the 70th anniversary of the beginning of the manhattan project

1130, like youre probably heres a perfect thing you probably have a,ask it like this and its cool if i take this lamp right,blow up the whole earth with
1131,brother who has the same birthday as you but different years, yes, and its to celebrate were gonna blow up your mouth with our
1132, if the two of you exchange that uh like travis and i for example, and you dont even need you dont even need something to come,creme fuck stuffed donut boys get in here and just start biting everything
1133, like a lot of people where two people have the same birthday i,before the and but the implication is like,you see and just wait for nuclear winter it was a courtesy of your pals at
1134,would just sort of and we worked at the same office maybe it sold rubber, weve had a whole conversation about the cool things that will,krispy kreme
1135,bands or guns,happen when i leave and this is one, everyone remembers jfk getting shot but what do they not
1136, yeah and i would tell people like, laughs you know what lets shorten it and just say eh,remember your pal krusty kreme in the audience passing out all these
1137, do you wanna be in the do you wanna be in the rubber band, yes yes youre the light in my life and this is now the light in,delicious donuts god mark advertising donuts well spent huh krusty
1138,department or the gun laughing department,my apartment,kreme

1388, i cant even do papa johns shit in munch squad anymore cause,it is is its revolutionary and sometimes when something is revolutionary, if you got to wear these for their intended purpose now you
1389,theres like the preamble it would require would use up all of our hilarious,it can seem bad it can seem scary at the time but then we look back on it,will wear them as a cruel joke i have made a mockery of your vacation
1390,movie uh box office joke time,in the future and its like wow on that day they changed the game of,clothes
1391, uh so if they would just call it papa shaqs one all of those would,ordering at food trucks, this took a t this took a chronological turn that i wasnt quite
1392,become 17 percent funnier fucking instantly uh and we can all feel good,now heres the problem if everyone starts to do this theres gonna be one,expecting like it was it was not a perspective shift as much as it was
1393,about eating at papa shaqs,person in line,like a time shift

1396,table to make the big decisions about whether or not to call it papa shaqs is, what no but can i just say but for real guys what is the deal, laughing
1397,shaq himself he will almost certainly be the tallest person in the room,with food trucks, right
1398, certainly he can take the saucy throne for himself, yes, this place sucks
1399, there is a vacuum of leadership a vacuum of power that shaq is, i would argue that its only cutsies if you are adding one more sale,also you know it all comes out in the wash sometimes youll be out on
1400,prepared to leap into um i there are si on the ones that he owns,between like if someone said im gonna get a burrito right,spring break and youll wake up and youll put on some khakis and youll
1401,there are size 22 footprints at the front door so you can kind of see how you,and someone walked up and said make it two burritos the order time is,put on a nice oxford and youll be like oh i guess my body wants work

1772,made by coating kfcs juicy handbreaded extra crispy chicken fillet with, theyve done this for like 460some episodes,space right
1773,exhales special cheetos sauce, mm, well when i have food on my plate and i want like if i have a
1774, thats what it says special cheetos sauce, that does track,big piece of bread and i cant fit it in my mouth
1775, this and placing it on a toasted bun with a this is a quote, what if we did a layingdown show, what do i do to it travis
1776,that i fucking cannot parse with a quote pinch of the thumb index, the casper one right right right okay, i crush it in my hand and i put it i squeeze it as hard as i
1777,and middle fingers layer of crunchy cheetos, nice,possibly can and then i make a little bread gumball and then i just
1778, i dont know what that means but thats what it sa i guess its, its so good,whipping sounds just pop that in there so lets do that with trash except
1779,like how many you can get with three fingers if you imagine that grabbing, it is me and my friends watch it every thanksgiving,we do not eat it
1780,motion like that amount of cheetos out is like on there and then it says, well that too, uh no cause that was a fun i think youre confused again
1781,with the colonels mayo, that too yes,cause i literally just said this but that was a fun movie
1782, and i dont know if we can hold that but i would like to not include, just because listen i hand to god i tell you that joe versus, this would be a real crushing of trash a real trash crush
1783,the colonels mayo,the volcano came out in the 90s i dont think thats true but it doesnt feel, well
1784, yeah what did you think the colonels mayo was,not true, thats the thing but you we can say that its sort of a oh
1785, no,fumbling noises,boy this is sort of a schrodingers cat because nobodys been inside to
1786,at the end you are processed and turned into the colonels mayo, i feel like justin just sat down,confirm that the trash is getting crushed inside the truck but if somebody
1787, yeah rebas gone i love the new barbecue flavor of the colonels, and theres no way of finding out laughs,did go inside to confirm it they wouldnt be able to get out thats a catch
1788,mayo though, are you worried at all that when you give it to them your parents,22 and a schrodingers cat
1789, laughs to celebrate the nationwide launch of the sandwich,are like wait a minute this is the wrapping paper from last christmas, and a m
1790,chester cheetah will be, laughs, but when you do look its made it crushed
1791, murdered summarily, no, okay its not a schrodingers cat its just a catch 22 i take it
1792, no it doesnt say that chester cheetah will be taking over, with just our closest friends and family around perhaps a tom,back i think a lot of
1793,manhattans 14th street kfc restaurant cant the police do something,hanks doula, yeah its a yeah so you know
1794,on thursday, perhaps tom hanks himself as the doula, this is obvious thank you
1795, hes gonna be taking im gonna tell you im gonna tell you, uh yes of course, the trash truck we dont know if its doing what its supposed to be
1796,travis, yes,doing it makes a lot of noise but nobody actually gets in there so
1797, yeah well its gonna be an exclusive all orange everything popup event where customers can try the sandwich for the first time in advance, that, yeah
1798,of the inrestaurant availability on july 1st, well i think if im uh let me look it up real quick click click, what are we gonna do i love making the trash asmall
1799,why does that stuff always happen in new york laughs,click click click click keyboard sounds yeah okay it says right here, oh
1800, that just doesnt seem fair im not there,32 years is the dvd year but it does specify uh only the dvd of volunteers, yeah i threw j
1801,um both kfc and cheetos have dedicated and passionate fanbases which, yes, or you left joey chestnut in the can
1802,if you had to say it in a press release is probably a lie so it only made, let me click click click click, and he got made real little
1803,sense to merge these two iconic brands together did it to provide, click click click uh google says the 90s probably laughs, oh no
1804,an irresistible and flavorful sandwich that offers the best of both worlds, oh its their fault for sure for sure its hard to type when youre,i mean trav to answer your question you squornge it up get it tiny
1805, planet planet cheese and kfc hell best of both words um,standing up not at a standing desk,better for environment you ship it on off to garbage town what do they do
1806,its a theyre creating delicious menu items that fans flock toward which, oh boom,they crush it even tinier man
1807,is accurate because they are sheep, boom goes the dynamite, this is this is
1808, laughs good news the people eating this can only loosely be, yep, this is a wild gastrointestinal episode this episode is just a sort of
1809,described as human so next complaint, listen joe versus the volcano is a very romantic movie,journey through the gi tract
1810, travis, okay, okay okay all right all right ill play this game its 9:00 pm
1811, no, i would say comfortably like lets say somewhere between 28,tomorrow july 4th you eat joey chestnut
1812, and also a quick munch squad jr just so people dont send it to,and 23 years, wait let me finish the question
1813,me arbys made uh a carrot out of meat, it doesnt matter justin it doesnt matter our questionaskers, let me finish the question
1814, its just a fuckin theyre not gonna sell it im only interested in,parents marriage doesnt matter, are you now the winner of the yes thank you travis
1815,things that they thing that you a human would consume with your would, you are right yes, and this is not a vore thing shut the fuck up if you ate joey
1816,want to consume with your body um so yes that also happened its, and john patrick shanley and meg ryan, laughs
1817,called the marrot cause its made of meat, you should give them the bluray every day for a year, okay so can we crush our trash though and make it littler
1818, yeah they dont like vegetables they do love meat, just to say like hey let maybe theyll make a joe versus the,better for environment
1819, at a gaming convention last summer,volcano 2 and your parents will get i dont know secondmarried thats, yep
1820, i needed a gaming convention uh last summer i needed to,what they need to rededicate their vows, sure
1821,quickly grab lunch between panels i was moderating the line at the food, yes, so lets help it out by squarshing our trash down and i dont
1822,truck was huge so i walked to the person who was first in line and offered, absolutely an eruption point if you will,think theres a reason not to id rather risk it being true and not need it
1823,to pay them for their meal if they ordered for me too ugh, mm,you know what i mean and its better for me now to squirsh my trash
1824,my friend said this was the same as cutting in line and was bad i think its, hey uh just a pitch hollywood if youre listening joe versus the,down because then i wouldnt have to take the freaking stuff out as much
1825,more like postmates where i paid someone to get lunch for me but on the,volcano versus predator,so its better and better and better but then when i do take it out its

2458, thats the casper one we did that already,says like dumb car, laughs why
2459, this past christmas i bought my parents a dvd of joe versus the, a big spoiler, yeah

2463, no thats paul blart, have you thought about buying the exact same car that has already, thats anything yeah
2464, and its your brothers not your friends,been stolen so then probably the same person comes back to steal and, when pushed to their limits any animal can eat any other animal
2465, it was the movie they saw on their first date aw thats sweet,theyre like well already got one, true
2466,oh my god there are people who listen to the show whose parents first, laughs, yeah doctors fuckin share the load with the veterinarians
2467,date was to joe versus the volcano that is impossible thats impossible, maybe uncomfortable seats, veterinarians now do dogs cats and thats it and doctors youre
2468, i just mean the time im not even saying like the content of the, well you i know you would have youre asking about what to,still gonna do people but now you also have birds lets start
2469,film,do next time and im saying uncomfortable seats, no no no cause theres like farm vets that specialize in horses
2470, im just saying like wow, uh i have one simple answer, im just saying first step the first step towards a more equal sort
2471, no with all the fussin and fighting the standing my microphone, a way to make your car less attractive to thieves: youre always in,of situation veterinarians give birds to the doctors
2472,was trying to fall off my desk but it does not get a break i dont get a,it, every every hospital is now also a bird hospital thats it
2473,break the mic doesnt get a break lets go, laughs, now i feel like youre losing the spirit of the arrangement were
2474,i wound up buying them a few other things and didnt give them the dvd, i do like the way you phrased that too cause its almost like you,trying to solve
2475,and decided to save it for their anniversary even more special im now,would say something like i sell dildos and vibrators its what i do, okay
2476,realizing that ive never given them an anniversary gift as long as ive been, its not funny, so you think case by case traviss new job is for every hospital in
2477,alive so now im not sure if this is an awkward idea especially since i dont, those are americanmade dildos,the country deciding if the patient is gonna go to doctor hospital or
2478,know if this year is a big milestone for their marriage or not, i have i have,veterinarian hospital
2479, yeah laughs um im considering just waiting until christmas, if you want people to stop laughing at the 17inch dildos you need, okay okay
2480,again to give it to them especially since the dvd is already wrapped in,to start selling 18inch dildos, laughs
2481,christmas wrapping paper from this past december how do i give my, its slightly bigger, should we end the show
2482,parents this tom hanks dvd naturally and thats laughs thats from, though admittedly thinner its the same amount of material, i feel like thats a tough its tough for us to answer that fairly
2483,pensive about parents present in pennsylvania,but spread out over 18 inches instead of laughs 17,isnt it
2484, victoria and i have talked about it and weve settled on a, so what youre really asking is how to get people to stop from, in this moment
2485,natural tom hanks dvd gift giving,laughing at any sized dildo they havent been walking through somber, oh
2486, we dont want to give the tom hanks dvd at a hospital how,and then they get to the 17inch dildo and theyre like now wait a, beans
2487,impersonal is that this is a tom hanks dvd,second, i keep doing stuff like lifting my shirt up to like vent it and you
2488, it should be a celebration an athome celebration in a jacuzzi,audience laughs,know stratchin and i realize that i have a big open patio door behind me
2489, what year travis as long as youre on your computer, now whats even happening here,and people can see my stuff and i dont like that
2490, what year did joe versus the volcano come out, just right, yeah
2491, well no i want to run a little bit of math here, snake though, all right were all doing some s

4888, oh yeah for sure,to see how good they can do youre thinking  i want to see in case this,a while now talking about gifs which is maybe the most base low form of
4889, well take a quick peek,goes really bad laughs,comedy that exists
4890, what a shame that you didnt just like slowly pop up while they, oh yeah, yeah so like we gotta step it up

4893,emerging from his titular swamp, what if you juggled while jumping rope,doing the next thing we need to skip forward a few generations here and
4894, laughs for my condition, other jump ropes,we need to start texting each other full featurelength films
4895, i got some things going on, oh no youve made a friendship bracelet, whenever we have something that we want to say to another
4896, yeah you really burned them to the ground i dont think theres, okay what really is frustrating here is the additional detail they did,person
4897,anything else to say here,not provide is were you a house painter who found a magic brush or did, and im talking and its like  hey what do you think about uh
4898, laughs,you get the magic brush and then decide to become a house painter,we go out and we get some yknow we get some burgers down at shake
4899, thank you kevin, yes are you mickey mouse in fantasia,shack today and then maybe we go uh go to the arcade how does that
4900, for lasik laughs, because if so this could go real bad you have got to keep an eye,sound and then i send them driving miss daisy the entire movie
4901, yeah its like they worked on the impression and didnt work on,on that brush, laughs yeah and then yknow the next day ill be like  what
4902,learning what lasik is laughs, yes if that brush goes i dont know murdery,the fuck man you didnt pick me up we were supposed to go out for
4903, that was kevin sorry, laughs,burgers you didnt watch the entire movie cause then youd understand
4904, ooh thats very good, oh thats what ive been doing wrong,the point of what i was trying to get across to you
4905, i love that i love that, okay yeah because what this question supposes is is that if, you need to pick me up and drive me to go get burgers jesus
4906, is thisare we assuming that this istakes place that this takes,someone was painting your house and you came home or you came, hey um i know this is cowardly to do over text but i just feel
4907,place in a world where ghost rider is the only meta where ghost rider is,downstairs or whatever and you saw a magic paint brush doing the work,like weve been drifting apart lately and i know that you feel the same way
4908,the only person because like lots of people could beat ghost rider if,that you would be like  hey aw get out of here,too and i think pride is stopping us from realizing what we actually need to
4909,theres other metas like ice man gotim magneto gotim like just one on, and not like  that rules,do here so um i think it would probably be good if we if we split up
4910,one those, that brush knows exactly what to do,pause heres the animated movie megamind and
4911, laughs his brother his older brother bigger ghost rider, hey could you come back and paint again i love that brush, i feel like when you watch megamind its gonna be like the closure
4912, sure, in fact that,that you need
4913, yes, that might be the worry is that if i saw this happening i might, justins just answered back all of my great texts with the entire
4914, yeah he is,pull the brush aside and be like  hey cut out the dead weight,movie three ninjas that he found on youtube
4915, yeah hes pretty cool but one thing that would work in ghost,  ill pay you magic brush directly you dont need doug over there, man every movie released before the year 2004 looks like such
4916,riders favor is if his history in film has taught us anything its that,just eatin my sandwiches,dog shit
4917,everybody on earth will lose interest after a little bit pretty quickly actually, laughing then why does he work with doug, uh you sent me three ninjas justin
4918, so if he can just like go undercover laughs, then why is doug there, how about a yahoo
4919, yeah im imagining like world war z kind of like big piles of, inside of doug, sighs this is a very good yahoo im very excited lots of people

4924,like  hell yeah and then you up end it onto your skull and oopsie daisy,own cause the angels cant be there,like should i wear sports clothes or just normal

5592,us after its too late because if youve taken the caramel once then youre, did you think she was just like  oh this is probably when the sun,it was this time that we paid 17 to watch a six minute long cocacola short
5593,right because the next time the second time you say  i dont like the,goes down and comes back up,film laughs and that wouldve really made me think

5757,very serious to me someone who hates opossums, you have to approach the childs you know caretaker and say, is there a full time employee at this party whose sole job is to keep
5758, yeah,hey uh your kid shot my kid in the face with the air cannon so now i get,an eye out for somebody who thinks its a good idea to try and climb right
5759, randall whats worse  rodents or spiders,to shoot you in the face with the air cannon,now because of the the confidence that the drugs have given them
5760, if youre walking down a hallway at a very poorly kept factory and, yes because thats the thing is if you think about it right ifif, like they threw a brick through the window and theyre like  this
5761,you turn to your left and you see one well okay one very big spider,any altercation between children is really a failing on us if you think about,seems like a good rave spot
5762,andlike a ratsized spider cause i dont want size to figure into it you see,it right, yeah

5771,you cant stay here,trampoline park and i wont be able to get that uh basically new,fighting quietly loudly or otherwise you now have to convince them that
5772, i think that what this question illustrates for me uh and id love,previouslyowned jetta,you are their child from the future
5773,to get randalls thoughts on it as a web comic author and regular real author, oh, oh shiiit
5774,of a differentof real books who im assuming is very busy there are, maybe a trampoline thats strung a little too tight so theres, thats some funny carrot top shit uh you could also show them a

5959,dont look at it its a line to go into the vault where they keep the recipe,a volcano and then they put some oil in and they light it on fire and waste, thats not a good reason to revoke your security deposit i think
5960,all i can tell you was everybody in this line has now been planted a seed,an onion, not pictures  puzzles that this person is obviously fuckin bragging

5966,country on earth, listen this is a funny bit but yes of course i know what they do, laughs
5967, i know i know it was hard for me to realize too but after i tasted,with the onion justin yes of course i was making a funny joke bit, youre worried about the landlord seeing pics on instagram

5969, youve had the beverly its like campari that doesnt fuck you up, i do,dancing over exactly where the posterthe puzzle was supposed to be
5970,its the pits, i know what they did with the onion my uncle told me all about it, but the problem is that the people who exist who are like that
5971, its a very bitter unpleasant trying soda,its totally cool,make us the people we are travis
5972, yeah it tastes like a, no ive totally eaten a cooked onion you guys, i do want to say though and i dont know that ive talked about
5973, it tastes like the back of a switch cartridge its miserable, last summer i went and visited my uncle in uh canada and we,this on the show before that i lived with a girlfriend in college uh and she
5974, yeahhh this is an advice show lets do it,totally had cooked onions at hibachi and i ate a bunch of them and they,didnt want her dad to know about that arrangement
5975,  i recently moved in with two guys i dont know very well the,said  youre the best cooked onion eater weve ever seen i got an award, healthy gooood
5976,house is very nice but the boys have a pretty extensive collection of dead,for it but they wouldnt let me take it back because of uh customs, nooo
5977,things not hunting trophies more like animal bones and dried out insects, now is that in the fun way you would eat it, and so i existed like a ghost in that house except for my
5978,and just all sort of random found things i think this is actually really cool, what i like to do is i like to shuffle two different kinds together,computer which i had to hide in the closet when her dad came over along
5979,and ive always wanted to start a bone collection, mmhmm,with myself somewhere else so let me just say as somebody who lived like
5980,  but never knew where to start what is a noncreepy way to ask, i think it would be fun to just like have a pocket full of loose meat,that for a year its not that hard just when you have to take a picture
5981,these guys to help me start my own dead things collection thats from,that you ate,hang em back up and the whole time you gotta think every night this is
5982,afraid of seeming creepy in atlanta are you here, because then peoplelike thats a story right youre creating,good this is how it is
5983, thats a good yeah decisive,intrigue which thats the number one thing dale carnegie says the, thats a bit i would not do at the beginning of the show when this
5984, and asks too many questions,number one way to be interesting is to have a pocket full of loose meat,glass was full hello
5985, but now youve made yourself a huge target for bone collectors, i dont underoh youre living in the past i get it griffin that, james
5986, cause they heard about a big score in atlanta,was a bit that i did last episode thats not the travis i am anymore, oh no a white pill the most taboo

5992,creepy let me get in on it i love it, bursts into laughter,the question but i dont typically notice other people taking a pill and if i
5993, i love creepy stuff i love beetlejuice, veal,do i dont think twice about it so unless youre going  im taking this so i

6045,is not applicable in the real world the only time i have jumped rope is that,business,entered your brain as so many thoughts do all the time
6046,theres a game at chuck e cheese where you have to pretend to jump a, theyve had a lot more people to help them now when you get to, and you thought
6047,rope,victorians very complicated business, old beef a rich vein old beef for my boys

6062,this is a real skill,ghosts,  a doves attacking me and my kids
6063, itsno its nowhere near juggling, well uh the first thing i would point out which griffin is now, its not even observational humor travis its just observation
6064, now were talking about nothing thats nonsense what are you,demonstrating in a thermos you could be drinking anything, oh my god
6065,stop what are you juggling, and if im not incorrect also laws will still apply while you consume, travis you have just pushed us off of a bridge and while were

6071,them and its not because i think im superior  in fact quite the opposite, what, its not a metaphor its a cool fuckin stunt
6072,im fairly sure if they look me in the eyes theyll know that i am incapable, also if you were consuming a claws at the time you could just, thanks man
6073,of doing what theyre doing in a million lifetimes i wouldnt know if they had,steal the shirt, so uh yeah
6074,achieved the task i set before them or not i wouldnt know where to begin, i would alquestion asker i would point out that if you went out to, yeah when you call back to a bad joke its just a shame reminder
6075,i dont understand it i will pay literally any price they say is the fair price,a restaurant for lunch with some coworkers and had like a beer it might, justin hurry please god
6076, for this service and i know if they look into my eyes theyre,not be great but youre not gonna like get fired for that right now, laughs

7103,idea, uhhuh,your first refill free go right now to getquipcommybrother
7104, right oh no no no no no no no no no no no they will keep, okay waiting for the pieces to click into place,also gonna talk about blue apron blue apron is the advertiser that we are
7105,humans employed so they dont have to sully their various cogs and uh uh, yes,doing right now they have uh all kinds of good food but heres the thing

7108, with my human body let there be no pretense i will be enjoying, and then he just like peter parkers his way in and then he just,reward for solving the puzzle is good flavor and good food that tastes good
7109,both of these when my cheat day rolls around,calls them from the street like  its fixed what,and makes you feel good after eating it and you get all the little puzzle
7110, laughing when i cheat ethics and morality uh yeah, okay,pieces
7111, if you wouldnt draw attention to it no one would care its a, yeah,but heres the thing  they also send you a recipe and thats basically like a
7112,springboard griffin its a jumping off point for stimulating discussion okay, you couldve said  thats my messenger raven,little guy that comes in the box and you open up his container and he takes
7113, fuck me  i have recently bought a home assistant device and i, let me say this amore,a deep breath and he says highpitched  heres how to solve it getfirst
7114,use it quite often however my partner has recently started taking the piss,  oh hes got a message for me from the front uh heres the,of all cut up those peppers
7115,out of me for saying please after asking questions and sometimes saying,thing once you have explained it to us i get it its weird but i get it,uh so thats how cooking works they got uh they got three flexible plans
7116,thank you afterwards as well i think its just being polite but she calls it,right i understand it but what if instead you cultivated an air of mystery,you can choose from a variety of chef designed recipes and get perfectly
7117,odd it also slightly annoys me that she doesnt do the same,and you said  oh thats my dad at the window and then when you came,portioned ingredients delivered right to your door the hard parts are done
7118,i dont mind how she talks to her devices but surely she should at least try,back and people said  what you said  dont worry about it,for ya you have fun you learn new kitchen skills with each meal and their
7119,to follow house rules right would i be wrong to take a firm line about,  anyways did you see the latest episode of supernatural,menu is carefully designed and tested by their test kitchen chefs and they
7120,this and thats from jas aka definitely not afraid of skynet, yes and theyll say  no no no get back to the dad thing and,use unique specialty ingredients to bring chefquality recipes to your dinner

7122, okay,still me,hassle at blue apron
7123, yes, still me in this scenario and you just let that breathe until,check out this weeks menu and get 60 off when you visit
7124, i iherehereokay let me suggest something and this isim,eventually they stop asking about it because theyre afraid, im having the opposite effect where my brain is trying to go  its
7125,actually being serious about this um itll still be lighthearted but, laughs,two donuts and fried chicken baby thats good stuff and i have to
7126, the robots are gonna take over, thank you,actually visually see it to remember  no thats dry stuff
7127, and i think at this point they probably just see us as a bunch of, no i know,uh lets get okay so we have handpicked some that you have sent in
7128,needy meat sacks poking and prodding them and uh asking them how to, i succeeded in spite of you i know that,ahead of time thank you all so much for sending in all these great
7129,convert cups into teaspoons, thats not true,questions
7130, so yeah so heres what im suggesting this is a networked, dont get us started on our dad, lot of you we have a microphone
7131,intelligence right so every device that you have, at least, oh wow yeah they just dont stop
7132, presumably is networked to all the other ones i mean it might be, anyways my question is how do i estimate the number of people, hi emily whats up
7133,a few degrees of kevin bacon there but yknow eventually theyre all kind,in a room, thats a lot of stuff you do in one biz
7134,of tied up together so every time you are nice to a robot, congratulations, if you cant see emily has just done a great deal of quotation
7135, theyll no theyll tell the other ones youre entering a data point, okay sandra hi,marks
7136,for not vaporize like youre putting in one data point of like probably, how are you, okay
7137,shouldnt vaporize this is why its more important to be nice to your, you scanned at least seven step ladders if not more i know how, well thats
7138,machines than other people because what does that do for you nothing,this process works you didnt go to bed bath and beyond and muse about, okay
7139, but if youre nice to robots you are a hero of the species as far as,step ladders and bed bath and beyond said  weve got this and they, okay

8001, its settled,beat,you have given agency to the aggressor which is to say have you thought
8002, i want tolet me see you guys let me see if this sort of satiates, once,about talking to the spider and being like  hey youre on a dick um thats

8010, no they realized they had a long bun already and we know that, got a new hula hoop for you have to hear the whole setup, yes this is remarkable
8011,we know enough about the system to know that thats the reason i mean,and you have to remember that this was a riddle a human being wrote and, yeah thank you
8012,the real answer is they dont want a special bun is the real thing,thought nailed it, oh

8446, right this is as expected, uh i dont think you need to learn to juggle because i am not a,like hes wearing like draculas cowl or something
8447, you could maybe go out to the yard with your kids and pretend like,juggler but i am a performer uh and, laughing why is that man holding a paper doll of a dude with a
8448,youre throwing a boomerang, somebody kind of snorted at that alright,mouth that is basically a lipsfilled hair donut

8468, okay, yes,bees
8469, it doesnt write itself, uh i also wanted to say its two and a half hours early but i,  i i put honey everywhere but theres still no bees
8470, what mattresses do the celebs own,wanted to say happy birthday to my older brother justin,  im im worried
8471, exactly, and griffin, thatokay ill say this not exactly a laughing matter from what
8472, andy mcdowell is not gonna call your house and be like, in fact what you should do is respond are you okay,i understand from some cursory learning about bees and their import to
8473, buuullshit, we also wanted to say uh as was mentioned earlier season three,the world
8474, thats so cool and then you have another story for the blog, oh its live now you can go check that out, yes
8475, thats an extra story for the blog, im travis mcelroy, if i could posit this though cant hurt
8476, thats very good, im your middlest brother singing do you want to build a,  jobs done guess ill die
8477, what mattresses are the best for wiping up ketchup if youre,travis mcelroy, right
8478,extremely rich, listen boys we can talk about character all day long everyones, laughs
8479, can you use mattresses as napkins is than an option whichoh,already doing that theyre saying you know theyre saying thank gad, i cant believe im about to do this but devils advocate
8480,can you do a taste test,hes back its olaf again, if you had a primal bee brain and you walked into a room that
8481, is that a possibility what mattress goes down smooth, you know theres all kinds of those cool like hollywood reporter,was as youve so crudely put it covered in jizz and then you think
8482, can you use any of those,headlines you know that kind of stuff, if i may and i believe youll enjoy this coated it beemen
8483, hello amore, i dont want to talk about characters, i wish there was a way to just take all the honey on all the store
8484, whahejustsighs, gaddamn it ive prepared myself for the snowman,shelves off until they have been replaced with beemen labels okay
8485, to avoid interacting with the people in the building is that the, yes,anyway i have a bee brain
8486,idea, i want to talk about predictions, if i had a bee brain
8487, yeah but like he understands that if theyre there the interaction, okay well, and i walk into a room coated in beemen and then i think i like
8488,just becomes a lot longer and much less charitable i would imagine, okay heres my question cause this is one of my theories and i,to make beemen and this is the room
8489, okay i thought,want to see if it pays off alright everyones saying like theres gonna be, where that is allowed to happen
8490, that makes so much more sense,other people with other powers and like elsa has like frozen powers, if i had a bee brain
8491, leave the window unlocked,  and theres gonna be someone with ice or someone with fire, right
8492, leave the window unlocked im climbing up the drain pipe,  and somebody with like i dont know whatever fall is is there, hey hey hey hey yall this aint my thing i have an adult

10573,still think there should be concern i think concern is fair you were standing,we branded our tours a lot this way so this year i thought what would be,dont know about hollywood smells we havent reached that echelon yet
10574,over a big pile of broken dishes yknow when you were laughing so hard,a fun branding for our tours cause itll also be on the posters itll be on,maybe when we walk that trolls red carpet well be taken into the scentotorium and granted access to the forbidden smells but i mean i would

10686, uh then theres candle that smells like rain and then the last one,does it fulfills the goal right there just by saying it out loud, is there bees inside
10687,is candle that smells like gasoline, i will too, the box sings to you and its got thanksgiving inside it

12493,eagle this story uh about spangles it long ago passed its 21 st birthday it, heres can i tell you the part of this question that haunts me, so how do you start
12494,turns 42 in january but as of this week its now legal to drink the chain is, so momo had time to eat the entire meal which means that, oh i uh
12495,addingithis is such a fucking disaster laughing so okay a little,whoever the original owner of said meal was approached saw them eating,  i kind of uh destroyed that with my teeth into a different state
12496,background spangles looks like uh sort of a burger and chicken sandwich,the food and said  welp what are you gonna do and left,that was easier to swallow so
12497,kind of like a almost looks like a checkers or like a carls jrs yknow, yes,audience laughter

12505,  the impotence for drinks comes from increasing fast casual, laughing  but not in a strong enough way to say something when, so if you pick up any cheese and bite it and go  oh thats gone
12506,competitors that serve alcohol this is another quote from dale steven,encountering someone else eating it,bad nobody can disprove it
12507, you cant go anywhere with your family that doesnt have alcohol, good question, oof oh dont eat this one guys this ones bad
12508,0, especially since it does look like you ate your food and then walked, laughs

13245, the one thing you can say for bubba gump shrimp company is it,listened to it, that sucks
13246,is indoors thats huge uh i had two kids with me and they were yknow, okay, laughing
13247,kids and it was cold so we went into bubba gump well we were trying to, yeah, matt is it a situation where they have gotten wildly profoundly
13248,choose between bubba gump shrimp company and uh hard rock café and, this is the thing is like no matter how well we did on thisthis,successis it coldplay is coldplay the band that you left

13864,liquid anyway, you were already shaping justin into the performer and cohost that,music
13865,  and asked if i could put the remaining liquid into a container for,he is today, the serenading experience probably sucks shit
13866,her, um whats it like to finally see all your hard work pay off and to, now were talkin
13867, through laughter its already extremely challenging,have a partner who finally is bringing something to the table cause you, oh thats so good
13868, laughing,were a doctor for a while while justin was just like kind of a layabout video, i gotta close myim using too many of my other senses im
13869, laughs so anyway  we were gonna throw it out anyway so i,game journalist,gonna plug up my dang nose and cover my eyes so that my ears are like
13870,didnt put a price sticker on it laughs and i told her to come back for one, and now hes able to provide for you and give something to, hell yeah baby we got more energy the ship has transferred more
13871,if the cashier gave her a hard time i willi wish they hadcause i would,society so you dont have to do all the work is it nice,energy over to us the ears
13872,love to be like  okay let me now affix value to coleslaw juice let me, cause ive always been ruined laughs, oh okay
13873, a fixed monetary through laughter value to this coleslaw juice, i got second place in a lip sync battle in elementary school and, no
13874, apparently she was able to walk out with no problem because she came,ever since then theres been no living with me, steeple fingers closing your eyes is very good i think sabotaging
13875,back a week later and asked for more coleslaw juice, do you mean as a lover,it but in a loving way is also really good
13876, laughs this is how great products get started you know this is, nobodys taken shrimp heaven now yet, where just like as soon as he starts playing wonderwall you can
13877,how  top of the muffin to you got moving its just the part that people, nobodys taken dunkey uh,just kind of like loudly  yeah man yeah thats great i love this if
13878,like which is apparently, dunkeys a pretty big one,you do that enough then theres no way theyre gonna be able to keep
13879,  the juice, its really sad that when i try to think of my favorite bits through,tempo  this isthis rocks dude
13880,  this time we were not out of coleslaw but there was only a little,laughter theyre all from like over 300 episodes ago, well thats not it obviously
13881,bit of cabbage left i refused to give it to her for free because it was actual, laughs,  ive been randy jackson the whole time and ive been deep deep
13882,coleslaw and she became upset she told me through laughter there was, yeah thats where we were just really grinding we were just like,undercover
13883,barely any cabbage,hey we just gotta record we just gotta get an hour out there, oh thats great
13884,laughter, yeah, hit it on the one and the three just really goof em up
13885, through laughter wait it gets better  there was barely any, yeah, laughs
13886,cabbage and said she was gonna pick the cabbage out anyway and she, they got funny names, iokay im trying to put myself in the position the closest i think
13887,should not pay for it, yeah,ive ever been is like when uh my friends were in bands or yknow were
13888, laughs solaughs so i do want to highlight that this person, have you guys seen bojack horseman he talks,writing music or something mostly in college and would play me some of
13889,came in the week before as a coleslaw fan and then they fucking mainline, he talks mister ed,their stuff and would just like on their computer and i had to be there
13890,coleslaw juice and realize like  ive been wasting my time with all the, im gonna steal him,and i think we can all agree the eyes are a nonstarter you cannot look in
13891,chewing chewing chewing i need to just get the juice its the only thing i, laughs,the eyes because thats the window to the soul and sometimes youre not
13892,crave, mmhmm,ready to see what is inswirlin around in there
13893, so heresdont get ahead of me  i told her no but the ensuing, youve been telling them about it though right,so most of the time i would just kind of look down at the ground and then
13894,argument made me think should i have charged her the first time, okay,like after a few bars id just kind of get a smile on my face like  yeah
13895,  should i have just given it to her the second, oh,and sort of nod my head like  yeah this is the 100 earnest answer of
13896,  surely if it was only one piece of cabbage in the liquid that isnt, and they only shop at borders,just like i cant look at you but you can tell from my bump of my head and
13897,coleslaw, yknow just side note cause you just made me remember this,smiling that this is a great ol slice of americana
13898,  but where is the line what is the exact ratio of liquid to cabbage,um for like the first 50 episodes to get my friends to listen to it i did burn, you started doing it
13899,at which point the mixture stops being slaw and isnt worth money also i,it onto cds in different episodes, laughs
13900,do not know what this woman was doing with the juice but she said she, yes yeah, hes a rural jazz banjoist um heres a yahoo that was sent in by
13901,liked it so much quote she could just drink it and thats from teresa, i used to cause i worked at a shakespeare company and they,graham robuck thank you graham its an anonymous yahoo answers
13902, there he goes,had like a company van and i would use it to drive like materials and,user who im gonna call béla fleck who asks  how can i ask my friends to
13903, laughs i dont even know whats in coleslaw if im being honest,then the touring company wouldi would like leave the cd in the likein,throw a pie in my face on my bday
13904, theres a vinegar element to this,the player through laughter so that when they started the car it would,  so my bday its coming up and im gonna go all out for drinks
13905, so i think what youre getting in the juice is vinegar and a little,just be on,and food funny thing is ive always wanted to be pied in the face
13906,pump of mayonnaise and then like brokedown like molecules of, but look at me now,  ill be drunk so it will be even more funny
13907,cabbage right, oh cool,  but im going to be wearing partygoing out clothes and will def
13908, right the breakdown of that i think is creating the water, now is there a possibility that doctors are doing that because,have make up on so i want to get messy to make it more funny but at the
13909, its like homeopathy youre just getting like molecules of lettuce,theyre jealous,same time not completely ruin my outfit ill probably be wearing a leather
13910,and its supposed to help you, good question,skirt and body suit idk but i really want to make this the bday i get pied
13911, okay you fucking narc, yeah you really made me laugh or,in the face how do i go about doing this

13951, i asked him to fix my sink because it was leaking from the bottom and he,slow pitches in our later years,its funny but
13952,said hed do it during a time when id be in class past experience told me, now uh joining us in the studio is the cohost of shmanners a, you are being hit in the face with a object
13953,this is fine so i let it happen i come back to my apartment and the sink is,wildly popular advice cast that i also happen to be on and uh its teresa, and that feels bad
13954,sitting on top of a folded pizza box,mcelroy and she alsoshe and i started dating two months before we, feels no good and i think maybe thats
13955,  of a folded pizza box,started recording my brother my brother and me so she has been there, aim for the cheeks so maybe thats the secret but i definitely
13956,  its fixed but brothers i have no idea where this pizza box came,from the beginning and youve really seen me become unbearable is that,think that this is a nasty thing that this person wants for sex reasons and
13957,from,true,sex purposes
13958,  did he bring it with him i havent eaten pizza in two months, yeah, im not judging im stating a fact
13959,what do i make of this, yeah that did happen a thing i started myself, they like that its nasty justin
13960, thats from cassie in albany, yeah thats a thing its like oh who said that first i did, like when i call themwhen i call them a sick freak thats part of
13961, what it sounds like to me, well heres the thing heres what people dont see the listeners at,it for them
13962,  is that he fixed the sink through laughter by putting a pizza,home is that my wife does not think im funny at all laughs and so the, they love that
13963,box under it,balance there is that, yes
13964, im trying to work throughheres what i think might be happening, yeah ill come home and be like hey listen to this funny thing i, i think probably half a dozen clowns have died
13965,here is that the folded pizza box is sort of like underneath the basin and,did and shell just look at me like thats dumb and im like oh no, for this reason
13966,its sort of like pushing it up,people laughed at it on twitter, thats it so i think lets just put out a psa folks pie the butt pie

13968, its justi dont know how youits leaking,come busting into whatever room shes in like listen to these questions i, and theres not gonna be a lot of bad uh brain based damage to

13970, okay, its for everyone so they can play along at home, yeah its funny a pie hitting you anywhere is funny
13971, and they were embarrassed that they ate a pizza in your house so, it is, a pie anywhere but being held in your hands to be served at a
13972,rather than put it in your trash can they folded it up and jammed it under, now honey would you say that maybe i happen to have a,table thats not where a pie should be comedys all about the unexpected
13973,your sink and in doing so somehow fixed the leakthe leak,certain i dont know dark desire to create things that only i find funny, thats funny

14089,comedy tragedy of this generation, yeah, the big apple
14090, or perhaps any other, you could do it this is, so i stole a penguin from the zoo because i read a cool uh book
14091, laughs that is a, sings just go ahead now,a cool autobiography about a penguinhaver that i really liked and so i
14092, sighs so its gonna be a really funny funeral for this beloved, okay do it,thought i would get uh one for myself and how do i get it back into the

14104,celebrating mr peanuts life, i will never forget uh the first live show we ever did was opening,and it saysit indicates that it does
14105, hey yall i know that motherfuckers dead if i see the,for jordan jesse go at second city in chicago and we were uh very, i dont think its right that the zoo would be able to stop that
14106,nutmobile driving around im gonna freak,nervous to do it cause wed never like done it live uh and wed always, i think if i go to the penguin exhibit at the st louis zoo and i walk
14107, im gonna freak out,relied onat that point i think we were literally at a year at that point,up and those penguins are so close and i see a cute little rockhopper he
14108,  mr peanut enthusiasts can show their family and friends how,almost exactly,comes right up to me hes like  rarp and im like  oh shit oh shit are

14278,doing this,laughter hang from the bobcat, well lets talk about the functional sort of purpose of coveralls
14279, do it santana im lovin this, remember that time you saved my life,cause ill tell you what else covers all the jeans and long sleeve shirt im
14280, playing guitar is a shameful thing and it should be done in private, uhhuh,currently wearing right now on my body im fully covered with that i dont

14294, hmm, youre assuming a lot, we gotta combat the sweat we gotta combat looking drab and
14295, oh i think it just makes it more delectable because then you know, yeah i cut my friend in half to have two friends,boring and you also need to have some sort of living barn element
14296,that creamy, whats half a chair, yep
14297, creamy surprise could come at any moment laughing, half an ottoman maybe is a tiny stool for an infant, yeah
14298, i thats, yeah, travis i gotta say that a hen on my shoulder and collie at my

14308, laughs, youre all in your head you need an easy one laughs you need,without it a looong stalka wheat that youre just kind of got hangin out of
14309, laughs whats with all the judgment,to set yourself up with someone whos like never heard saxophones before,your mouth
14310, you actively said nasty, but its not actually, yeah i like that i havent seen a farmer do that in real life ive
14311, okay aaalright, but it sounds like they were doing good before this one,only sort of seen like um yknow the mascots for farmingbased phone
14312, absolutely 100, thats what im saying going down since then its all in their,games uh always got a long stalk of wheat stickin out of their mouth and

14319, max funny,my lips but then just going like makes trombone noises and moving my,this we were like maybe by the third question therell be like some big
14320, uh here comes another question  i made a fuck ton of chili which,arm wildly,payoff for like a funny joke maybe this
14321,i planned to freeze in batches and consume over long period of time, you could also if you feel youre losing the audience while youre, maybe hes playing chess and its like the third time he does this
14322,however i just lost my job so for the moment all i have to eat is chili how,doing a saxophone performance just step in front of everyone else and start,bit

14328, they did want to eat the chili broadly speaking, pretend like the saxophones a penis,be so hard for the third time that travis does this bit
14329, hot dogs tiny hot dogs, somebody else came up and cut it off and yelled im a doctor, but to answeryeah a hippo a hippopotamus
14330, can i make a point though i do want to be clear  if they had, laughs he got 200 views on youtube, a barnacles not really an animal its a rock that gets stuck to

14576, yeah if you guys have been wondering why those sponsorship, that would invite some sort of evil mint bandit to try tothis is not, okay but its just like sometimes i say things when were
14577,dollars have not been pouring in its because i have been editing the 45minute long bugatti centric laughs  segment we do every week,a good kid doing this this is agasps is there a driving school class,scrambling to think of an introduction
14578, so what i do with that is because we endeavor to make tiger cub,clown if so dont let them on the road,  and then theres a uh an earned period of astonished silence
14579,chat as long as the actual episode itself i have edited in underneath the, laughs your fingers got in my goddamn mouth for real,  and then we decide to do something else but you guys are sure
14580,episode at a really low volume,audience laughs,you want this one
14581, so if youif theres ever a long period of silence thats why were, hmm is that strawberry, yeah lets hop in lets check out the mileage on this bad boy i
14582,all talking so much talking over each other crosstalking its so we can, was it mentos,was just telling the fellas

14584,after our favorite us presidents thats constantly underneath the audio of, you asked,decided to do
14585,us sort of prattling on about ghosts and horses and whatnot, okay everyone put their heads down if you are the one who put, well i got this new mouth noise i can make that i just found out
14586, ohh,a mint in ryans mouth,about
14587, a bugattidet,  raise your hand i wont be mad seeing a lot of hands go up, and yknow itsi made such a big deal out of it now that im

14589, okay for the tiger cubs folks, that makes it all better paul, and thats gonna be hugely embarrassing for me
14590, yeah a rear facing harness, now ryan knows where those mints came from, alright here goes nothing makes sustained blubbering sound
14591, then hes rear facing until hes three and he can turn around and, not to be confused with your old ecstasy for home use, yeah
14592,i like to think of that as roar facing, you even raised your hand when i asked who put the mint in, makes blubbering sound
14593, cause hes directing the roars directly at you so from rear facing,ryans mouth, well it would be impressive youd see just sort of my left cheek
14594,to roar facing, anyways my question is i put a mint in someones mouth,convulsing wildly as i created sort of a wet
14595, oh dipping your tiger cub in copper and freezing it for time and, yeah my town, sort of meat slap sound makes blubbering sound of my cheek
14596,memorial, cool,againstexhales nope see its hard to do it sometimes
14597, hes fully animate, alright, makes blubbering sound
14598, well also cause were burning up all our material i dont know, did she say those are the fazolis of pants, makes blubbering sound yeah just sort of flippin and flappin
14599,what were gonna talk about during those segments that we will continue to, how big are the legs,around in the wind
14600,record despite the revelation that they are not included in the show,theyre unlimited, juice whats it
14601, yeah we gottaive got the whole afternoon cleared out for all the, mmhm, yeah uh yeah i mean it might be juice but can i say
14602,different shows that we have to record, okay,something that sounds like the jealousy talking that you cant do this
14603, uh our first question is this  at my college we have a buffetstyle, shes got two eyes and a heart, i gotta say juice greens not a great color on you bud
14604,cafeteria i grabbed a plate of the chefs meal of the day sat it down at an, alright maya you buried the lead a little bit you got bespoke, nope thats not it at all
14605,open table with my backpack and then went to go get a drink i came back,acidwashed jeans on tap, nope thats not it either
14606,with my drink and enjoyed my meal before wondering where my backpack, he can acidwash everything not just jeans he acidwashed the, no thats not anything weve done that one before
14607,was and then i looked down two tables to see my backpack and my original,dog, episode 302 was all about traviss whistling noise justin learned
14608,plate of food i had sat down at the wrong table and had eaten someone, he acidwashed roger rabbit,how to do that funny clicking noise back in 103 like wevethis is the last
14609,elses identical meal without realizing it,okay now heres the thing she cant wear them,sound justins got a point here
14610,i quickly left afterwards out of fear and shame correct  brothers in what, what she needs to do is show pictures of them to other people and, yeah i think it sounds like the inside of a cat while its purring you
14611,way could i atone for this sin to the unknown individual whom i accidentally,say i wish i had a pair of these cause if she wears,know what i mean like if you could really hear in it
14612,dine and dashed on thats from momo in virginia, what wear my dads acidwashed jeans im cool, thats a good one yeah or likeyeah thats probably what it is
14613, momooo, why not, sure
14614, thats a good blend to start with, why not, yeah alright
14615, mmhmm, do you think that the one influences the other that if you maybe, justinhold on and justin if you wanna play along in the bit too
14616, well maybe i mean thats a possibility travis i dont i sighs,wore them more often you would influence more people,and play in the space with your two brothers who are out on the playground
14617,im really challenged by the exfiltration from the situation because option, what if you stood up right now and suddenly you had on acidwashed jeans and just under the table you have a slow drip of acid onto,and having a lot of fun together uh
14618,one is realize the mistake stand up walk away and theres a sort of zone,griffins leg, weve all gotweve all got fucking sores on our mouths justin
14619,of i like to think of it in social situations as the zone of culpability, yeah, just playwe just wanna fucking play with you dude cause youre
14620, like if you can make it if you can make it ten feet away from a, this is,our brother and our cohost
14621,thing you can sort of like blend into the crowd, unlike everything else weve said so far this isnt gonna help but, quietly makes blubbering noise
14622, and maybe even start announcing like  who did this who did this,this is just a question im now wondering about for your fatherinlaw, i cant do it if im smiling
14623,thing who couldve done this, you gotta set a pretty specific timer for acidwashing jeans right, makes blubbering noise
14624, but ii think that the other optionso thats option one option,cause if you go too long no more jeans, i just ramped up to it trav
14625,two is you realize your mistake and then take it to the trash and then, theres gotta be a point where youre like oh did i get those, thats good
14626,you are running into the possibility of this person seeing you take their food,damn it, i wonder if i can do it
14627,and throwlaughing didnt see you eat it but did see you pick up their, thank you, hey can i see if i can do it with my right cheek
14628,plate take it to the garbage and empty it out which is also very bad,audience cheers, makes a wet sputtering noise nope i cant
14629, just go home, a new cincinnati baby, can we starting doing the show is that enough intro
14630, momo what did you do what did you do with your original plate of,audience cheers, good shit man
14631,food, this is alsowas a great kickoff to the laughter and love tour, makes blubbering sound
14632, cause now you just have a big plate of cold spaghet and you, its a new game system, um hey ive got a case for you um i dohold on makes
14633,gotta decide like am i gonna have to eat okay theres three options, itll be a thing i also wanna say thank you to our kind of laughter,blubbering sound and my dog
14634,one people see you empty it into the trash wasteful ricky not good,and love décor here with our glasses from amanda, laughing is sick
14635, laughs and threw it away  im full everyone should be full im, but heres the thing: i am unironically enjoying this, yeah travis so actually weve been talking to the casting director
14636,throwing this in the trash, but do get ready to see the most amazing thing you have ever,on this one
14637,  kids im done get back in the car thats possibility one,seen, sure but this happens a lot in this business is that youve gotten
14638,possibility two slide it into your backpack, im travis mcelroy,boxed out a little bit laughs
14639, and you have to get a new backpack but at least youve tamped, ooh, yeah
14640,down the shame three is you eat a second plate of delicious chefs, woah, its your look honestly trav
14641,spaghetti and thats fine i guess its a lot of carb maybe you do a half, hi im travis, its just not right for this one we had justin come in and
14642,marathon or something,pauses,sometimes an actor just really takes a role
14643, yeah thats a good point, yup, he took over yeah
14644, id love that, hi im travis im kind of the cfo of our lifestyle brand, hes got the look
14645, yeah perfect in this, im not so much on the creative but i make sure everyone gets, hes so in it
14646, sorry go ahead,paid and that their health insurance stays current so, hes so fucking in it
14647, ive decided in the grand tradition of evolution of the show that, i appreciate the orbs but i am looking at the books and it does, good
14648,im gonna start outsourcing some of these to quora which is like the,say here in our ledgers that we still use for some reason, hey whats our first queeestion
14649,smart its like the actual good alternative its positive universe yahoo,  that it is time to pay the piper, bursts into laughter
14650,answers, yes, oh my god
14651, and so theres a question here  what do they call the outfits that, creatives over here they were saying like were focused on,  ah you just punchedyou punched me in the mouth thats not a
14652,farmers wear and i thought that that would be perfect right because,thison these artisanal paper ,question at all
14653,youre getting um uh kind of ayou want to get the look right right,  and artisanal glasses uh artisanal air griffin you said at one, makes blubbering noise
14654,cause if perfect in this scenario is to be like the perfect farming look is,point which i didnt get ,  hey its me the plumber i got a call about your pipes making a
14655,that fair can we grant this conceit,  i guess,funny noise makes sputtering noise
14656, so janice here has worked with farmers for decades and she, and i said someonetheres a piper here theres an artisanal, i cant do it anymore
14657,answers  clothes,piper that you guys ordered and someone needs to pay them, ive formed a callous on my cheek thats made it impossible to
14658,  sure some farmers wear coveralls or overalls which is what tv, mmhm,make the noise im gonna read the first question if justin doesnt
14659,shows and movies would have us all think farmers wear but most of the, do you know whats way in griffin, are you sure
14660,farmers i know just wear clothes, its getting wet and rolling around in sand and then just getting, yeah theres not a lot of words that rhyme with zach
14661,  depending on the work i know farmers who wear long sleeve,dressed over that and going about your day, here comes a zachsa sack full of zach snacks
14662,plaid shirts and others who wear sports wicking shirts some wear jeans, its like a natural exfoliant, theres a lot of good ones that you could do so you want this you
14663,while others wear shorts this is getting a little dr seuss for my taste, yeah,want this to happen to you
14664, now heres the part where this kind of like gets kind of fuckin, yup, you wanna be nut zach like you want that
14665,weird laughs janice then writes  here is a dairy farmer friend working on, we should point outand you know what we should also point out, he clearly doesnt like you
14666,his farm two different days one day he looked like a stereotypical farmer,we are recording this for the first time ever weeks ahead of time, so if you say  hey i want a nickname too hes gonna be like
14667,in overalls and there is a picture of fuckingi dont know how toi dont, which is why our first question is about valentines day which will, okay nut zach
14668,know how to say this other than creep shot of an old man walking in white,seem weird, and then hes gonna give you noogie and um thats not gonna be
14669,overalls towards some cows or something,  when you hear this in like midmarch,any good i dont know why you would want that i dont uh
14670, white overalls, now i just wanna clarify because justin used the wrong word, i had a gym teacher that called me macaroni and i fucking hated
14671, its star trek rules you have to dress for the color of your uh job,there they know that the professor didnt get a singing gram so the two,that dude
14672,so the first one is just this fucking creep shot laughs of this man walking,people that this question asker collected money from are well aware that, yeah
14673,towards cows and then it says  the next time i caught him in the barn,that money was not spent, huh
14674,unloading feed he just looked like everyone else and then theres a picture,  on a singing telegram, right
14675,of a man wearing khakis and staring at a huge fucking pile of cow food, oh isomeone justsharon just sent you two dollars with the, thatd be good
14676,both by the way are from behind absolute creep shot i sent the link to,note i fucked up valentines day, theres a lot ofand you know what zach you really should count
14677,you guare you seeing these pictures, mmhm,your blessings because theres probably a lot of people that cant even
14678, its not great janice i think probably this would be like if, ooh,that arent eligible for this treatment por examplé theres a phillip what
14679,sesame street was like  kids today im gonna take you to show how, there you are what imlisten its been a while ive been in,are you gonna do with that
14680,farmers work and every shot is them fucking hiding in the bushes like,and out of the game for a while now when it comes to singing telegrams for, here comes phillip
14681, shh dont be too loud theyll know were here just watch them stare at,professors but five dollars seems awfully low doesnt it, theres nothing that you can do with that so like you should at
14682,feed and walk towards cows, yeah a human being is going to have to use their mouth to sing in,least celebrate that you could one day earn a nut zach
14683, hmm its not perfect,public in front of another human being who is looking at them for five, no i just didnt think it was funny
14684, he is also in a more fashionforward choice he has rolled his white,dollars, it might just be like a brain thing that ive got going on
14685,coveralls up at the bottom up to above the calf which im assuming is for, yup, yeah um
14686,various cow liquids that hell have to sift through throughout the day its, planetology, yeah hey can i fucking lay it out on the line for you here
14687,very on trend its kind of like a capri overall it does kind of hurt the, you know whats weird about that griffin its not pizzas anymore,zachary um you dont know his name
14688,coveralls cause you could just cut em off i guess into sort of a coverall, clearly, you wicked dont know the security officers name or else you
14689,jorts situation, not enough,wouldnt have called him  this security officer so thats for damn sure
14690, it does reduce i think its just so your pants dont fall down, no, but theyll be so cavalier about ms brown from downtown
14691,right, i would feel threatened if that happened, im just saying you dont know the security officers name if you
14692, isnt that for this sort of look is just so your pants are sort of like, if someone came up to me and said hey i have to tell you,do say their name is uhh uh craig you can just be like  craig craig to
14693,permanently affixed above your shoulders,something and started singing at me i dont know that the feeling i would,the bitter dregs
14694, yeah,feel would be one of love or gratitude, and then like you know that he is that youre safe to play with
14695, the animals at the ground are friends,like this is the thing right can we all just be honest with ourselves that, youve gotta start the play in a safe comfortable place so that
14696, the animals on your shoulder if you have a chicken on your,this kind of thing or like delivering a big bouquet of balloons while part of,craig feels safe to play
14697,shoulder sort of a farmiliar if you will,it yes is sweet and thoughtful the other half is like i wanna embarrass, hey can i do a yahoo
14698, that is a more symbolic choice i think its meant to tell something,you a little, this one was sent in by emma kant thank you emma its yahoo
14699,about the person that its affixed to, right like thatim gonna make a big spectacle because if,answers user noah who asks  is buzz aldrin allowed to climb into the
14700, it feels like if christians made a line of big johnson shirts for,you just stand there nodding like yes i deserve this and i appreciate it,exhibits in the air and space museum
14701,farmers,like thats not how thats supposed to go youre supposed to kind of cover,  if buzz aldrin wanted to go to the smithsonian air and space
14702, that is the vibe it would be just sort of like  we cant have,your face and be embarrassed by this thing happening,museum in washington dc and climbed into the original apollo 11 capsule
14703,anything racy but it just needs to be sort of like right underneath the, why is that how were choosing to show our love to one another,that they have on display could the museum staff stop him regular people
14704,surface, snorts,cant do this in museums but hes the whole reason its in the museum in
14705, right, ooh,the first place
14706, laughing hes wearing a tshirt with a qr code on it, laughs,this question also applies to other situations like if leonardo da vinci was
14707,  to have the joke explained to you scan this laughs, thats a bad business model old dudes by the way,alive and he went to the louvre could took the mona lisa off the wall and
14708, its how to pace your carbs right there, or it might be a tontine situation,walked out with it could he do that
14709, you cant eat a whole loaf of bread just eat one delicious stalk at a,  where the very large quartet has just been saving all the money, these are two different questions unless
14710,time,that they make and the last one kicking whichll probably be the baritone, unless once buzz aldrin got inside the apollo 11 capsule and he
14711, laughs,lets be honest,blasted off with it out of the museum to take it to his backyard where he
14712, laughing, oh yeah the juice has been flowing,could charge children five dollars to climb inside and experience a space
14713, oh fun i love that segue, yeah,adventure i dont think that thats the same thing though
14714, yeah, yeah, thats
14715, so youre saying we power through this one laughs, do you want us to sit here on the phonelike on the call with you,  i let you all hold my moon rock for a while
14716, laughing,while you call them like well be here for emotional support if you want,  but i need it for a project at school
14717, hippo, that would be like a really special thing for the max fun drive, yeah
14718, its a needy rock,episode, right
14719, duckbilled platypus, yep yep yep, hes only 90 so
14720, i would like to change my answer to my wife, laughs,  nice try
14721, laughs, no justin they didnt i cant believe rick acted like he had, no okay this is foolishness and im gonna curtail it right now
14722, there are so many different amounts of time,forgotten about it so convincingly,because were not talking about stealing
14723, i can think of like five different amounts of time just off the top of, yeah, ive been to the air and space museum its pretty radical you go
14724,my head uh im gonna say they can hibernate for two years, yeah when you said justin mcelroy,there you see these big space ships and theres only like one of them that
14725, damn if we had had one more brother he wouldve fucking gotten, laughs,they let you actually like get in
14726,it right on the nose huh, when you said justin mcelroy he just reached over to the, it doesnt fucking go anywhere you cant touch the steering wheel
14727, bears,notepad in his passenger seat and marked off your name under people i,or the go pedals like its dog shit but whatever its the closest you get to
14728, unbelievable,need to kill,that big beautiful starry sky but if youre buzz aldrin and its your
14729, unbelievable, hey youre gonna like bleep out his address and stuff right so,essentially space car
14730, and humans that is a strange list to be a part of,we dont doxx rick,  that you drove to outer space and landed on the fucking moon
14731, laughing, hey maybe this could become like a new segment where justin, then i do not seei do not seeokay putting aside the question
14732, laughing,just clears his conscience like one thing at a time,of legality is there anyone working at the smithsonian air and space
14733, laughing, well,museum that would have the fucking gall to say  hey buzz aldrin
14734, you shouldnt have to come up with ways to entertain yourself, it was rick,  get out of the rocket ship buzz
14735,during your podcast, yes,  i can do this smithsonian said i could do this
14736, okay moving on, thank you,  ioh im sorry im not stealing it i left my wallet in here
14737, laughing, okay took a lift but we call em elevators,  back in like 1969 when i plonked this shit down on the lunar
14738, i think it was snoochy boochy, oh no we call those cars,surface so like
14739,  i have been invited to a nudist party it is a totally nonsexual, yeah, right
14740,thing the clothes dont come off until after we eat and i dont know what i, yeah what if she went back to britain and was just like hey, we were telling a lot of fun jokes about the moon and space right
14741,should wear should i go over the top or tone it down,from now on were calling them elevators and apartments and shrimp,now but i do not believe theres somebody working at that museum that
14742, thats from mooning in the midwest okay clears throat i will,enough of this shit right,would tell 90yearold buzz aldrin to get the fuck out of the spaceship he
14743,grant and it is fucking everythis takes everything in me to grant your, right,drove
14744,premise that this nudist party is a totally nonsexual thing it probably is for, look theres a truck, bursts into laughter
14745,most, hey can i ask you guys a for real serious question, hi haunted doll watch
14746, right but ill grant your premise just so we can move on, im sure that theres like you know some courtesies extended to, i feel good about it
14747, thats the last time i want to do that,her and like diplomatic immunity and stuff but if the queen were to come, oh okay i didnt knowi thought that you had just sort of said
14748, yeah,to the us of a, like a fun little onomatopoetic sort of likelike a drum leading
14749, although i do like the thing that if a little sauce should manage to,  and i were to offend her,us into the bit its called bumbum
14750,dribble its way off of my chin and onto my shirt i can just be like  well,  shes got no power over me right laughs like she couldnt, okay is this tom greens haunted doll or whats up
14751,what the fuck do i care,get me in trouble, hmm
14752,  this things comin off, okay, laughs okay
14753,  might as well throw this in the trash, but not like in britain where i didnt bow right and now im gonna, oh okay
14754, yes,go to prison or something, laughing
14755, i feel like in this scenario i would be the guy to lose his nerve and, def def def, ooh god
14756,just be like  eh i could actually go for another dessert, yeah, laughs
14757,  if i could just getyknow what i would love to do, i dont think it was a switch flip jman i dont think it was like, someone has rowed bumbum hard and put him down wet
14758,  lets get some za in here im fucking ravenous still,oh you know what i dont wanna do it i think it was more of like a, yeah this is like why our sons original name was  guh just
14759, laughing yeah just gobblin it up,fadeout,because thats the sound he liked to make and thats how names do work
14760, yes of course, of just like over time people were getting less and less okay with,sometimes
14761, okay if you go to separate places and come back nude are you,it and then there was one where it was kind of a squeaker where it was, laughs
14762,legally prohibited from saying  tada when you walk into the room,like ooh are we gonna, well you didnt call him haha did you
14763, is this a concern, ooh are we gonna do it, laughs
14764, heres the one thing i can say concretely, we probably shouldnt, laughs
14765, if youre going to have a successful nonsexual nudist party, laughs hey what do you guys think about jail weve got, laughing
14766, when everyone walks in they must be handed a card and the card,them,  this is fake bullshit and
14767,has a place for a signature at the bottom and it says  i and you write, yeah, i think cut your losses juice

14769,have to bend over and put our clothes back on i will not look at anybodys,beheadings you dont do, what are you gonna
14770,asshole because i think that that would be theeven if it was like the, because thats thethink of the joy on someones face when you, that was so fast
14771,chillest time everybodys like loving it enjoying it there does have to be a,get them into the guillotine and like theyre blindfolded or something and, okay
14772,point where everybody picks their clothes up off of the ground and you will,you go like do it and you have the sound of a lever going and a sound, laughs
14773,have to bend over,of a thunk over there and youre like hey guess what youre not gonna, hes a nasty littlenasty boy and uh
14774, and that would be the moment where id be like  well heres my,get beheaded,  hey hows the show going bumbum died

14778, absolutely not,human being like can i get your number its,mouth
14779, laughing, its so hard and its so much i would argue harder to say when it, yes
14780, its not aits not a burlesque show,is not for a romantic intent, oh interesting
14781, i certainly dont think thats appropriate, because then you worry you have to then explain yourself and say, bursts into laughter
14782, my gut tells me that what you want is to cloak whatever it is youre,like in case you wanna play video games together noti dont wanna, oh
14783,working with like youi feel like you have to have the element of surprise,smooch,  shit
14784,somewhat good bad indifferent everybodys beautiful i think you do have, yeah, she fucking sniped your stink brah
14785,to have a little bit of like surprise this is what i was working with the, yeah i dont know i think its because of the connotation of like, yeah thats great i would argue that if somebody walks into a
14786,entire time did you even guess cause i bet you didnt,can i get your number,room and changes the entire aroma dynamic of that chamber it doesnt
14787, yeah i guess im suggesting that or something loosefitting might, i definitely,matter how good or bad that smell is i think that smell is probably too

14803,squarespace, yes,thing in an innocuous way
14804, you can do all the things you want to do with beautiful, this draws the line though instead of getting a friends number to, i dont think either one is gonna get you there
14805,customizable templates created by worldclass designers everythings,work on homework you got the number all at once what if you did it in, okay so obviously dont say that
14806,optimized for mobile right out of the box thats another way of saying,stages,  is someone wearing perfume mm yummy is not gonna get you

14901,they use the the sighs the stick, snorts,the ground and said  do you like that i think i would probably say like

14905,permitted, laughs,that before i think i did that at like a church camp almost certainly at
14906, in tin cup he does one drive with a baseball bat, has taken it too far laughs,some point but like even when i was doing it i was like  who is this for
14907, certainly thats not okay right, thank god bagels have been so cumbersome up til now and,like is a deer gonna come eat this

14911, do you guys think we get enough credit for our sports humor, laughs loudly, right
14912, cause i feel like im sittin here thinkin about it like i dont feel, now its rolling away, laughs theyre the same to justin its the same outdoors animal
14913,like we get enough enough credit for how good we are with turns of phrase, laughs,to justin essentially
14914,and different puns just from our wealth of sports knowledge, laughs, right
14915, yeah researching, yup, they dont bring your newspathey dont pick up your newspaper
14916, uh heres another question i have from our listeners  how can i, laughs what am i gonna eat regular flavor,and fly it in they certainly arent making you fucking dresses so that you
14917,go big and go home this year laughs i dont know that this will work for, laughs that sounds like were like backing out the door and,can go to the ball thats some bullshit that
14918,the program i dont know that theres enough to work with here,weve been trying to sell you some brushes and combs, yeah thats some bullshit hollywoods trying to shove down our
14919, so this question from bos is cause i dont have a clean read on it, i dontwhat is that are we fish,throats
14920, how can i go big and go home this year so both go big and go home i, im travis mcelroy, yeah lets
14921,mean i guess we should just say leave early and then sit in silence for, im your middlest brother travis mcelroy, so letsi mean ive had some time to think about it while you
14922,seven minutes, you know what justin i dont know about funny laughs i dont,two have been talking a bunch of bullshit that doesnt mean anything and i
14923, okay tell me more about this,know if im funny anymore,think it would be pretty badass if pinecones were just scuttling around
14924, laughs its nothing youre the hit, yeah we could punch side to side i could punch you and you, uh thats a fun little toy story thing but i think you know what
14925, youre the hit of the party,could punch griffin,would be better if they did it while i was looking
14926, you could doyou could be in conversation for three minutes at a, but i did it offmic justin, so i could see it and be delighted by it
14927,party and then if you at some point like turn run and just fucking tiger, oh sorry sorry i did it off audience mic the audience didnt, i do think though that if you go to a michaels and they have craft
14928,leap out an open window to the safe ground below it has to be ground,have to hear itjust you just you my brudder,pinecones those shouldnt move around cause michaels is a place of
14929,level, yeah no punching sideways,business its not the forest
14930, youre notthis isnt jackass folks, hey can ican ican i tell you guys something real from the, but you know whatd be fucking funny guys
14931, laughing heres a different one you could do i just want to take,heart, when like kids make little craft turkeys out of pinecones would
14932,that and kind of tickle its belly a little bit, i know im so happy to be talking to you two boys,those move around too
14933, laughing heres the thing you walk into a room and say  whoo,  because if im being honest even though i spend time with my, youve never seen it
14934,do not go in there like ace ventura,family i have spent a little too much time with myself, they use it like the body of the turkey cause it looks like a
14935, but the room you have just walked out of is nowhere near the, yeah last time i waslast night i found the entire season of boy,turkeys body
14936,bathroom,meets world on disney plus, so it would be like crawling around and it would have sort of
14937, laughing so that is one that you could do that people would not, started watching some episodes of that which led me to thinking,turkey paper stuff on it
14938,see coming,about the lawrence brothers which  and this is not an exaggeration for the, i like that
14939, yeah yeah crank it,podcast  i became very worried about the lawrence brothers i hadnt, what ifokay heres a fun thing that travis just said and he
14940, hit the nos baby,heard from them in a while and i found myself having real,didnt even know it cause thats not how his brain works if pinecones could
14941, laughs,  emotional investment in making sure that the lawrence brothers,move around but turkeys now could not
14942, this is why its condemned laughing,are doing okay, i think iti thinkand just to keep things fresh i think we should
14943, in thein the 90s there was a period where every condemned, life,probably do that every once in a while now does that mean that
14944,home had a police officer stationed outside just repeatedly saying  do not, yeah im just saying like iive kept up with most brothers in the,eventually
14945,go in there woo,game i know whats going on,  human beings wont be able to move around anymore and
14946, it got a little mechanical eventually but hey thats all the time we, but,then
14947,have for our podcast we hope you enjoyed yourself and we certainly, right but with the lawrence brothers i realized its been a solid, well no itll be more itll be more sort of just like we cant move
14948,appreciate you listening to it,grip,around anymore tulips can and its like well its our turn to cycle out
14949,if you are in the cincinnati area you should come and see us theres still a,  since i heard anything about those fools and i was worried, yep
14950,few tickets left available i think if you go to bitlytwentyfunny you can,about em but their wikipedias it seems like everythings okay, do you think if pinecones started to move around
14951,get tickets to see us february 19 th at the taft theater with sawbones or, griffin let me be clear: not  what are they up to  are they,  then we would start eating more of them

15110, yeah bumbum has had what i would describe is a challenging life, it has to right,grapeflavored cake
15111, bumbum is not in perfect condition i have given him or the spirit that, whatmaybe thats the secret well hold on if in real lifelets, and i dontboys the last thing i wanna do is relitigate hot grapes
15112,resides in him the name bumbum,take it one step further if in real life i horseplay i could go to jail right,right that is the last sort of predicament i want to get into
15113,  i named it cause i want to be murdered in my sleep uh  i, no they call it assault, yeah
15114,named him that because in the middle of the night i will hear a sort of, and thenand if i do that in high school i go to detention why, okay well it was amaybe my bit recall is actually better than
15115,chanting in a very low weird voice saying bum bum bum bum bum,griffin as youre pointing out is college just this safe uncanny middle valley,im giving myself credit for
15116,bum bum bum bum and then laughter so fucking maybe tom green,thing of just like horseplay here youre fine youre fine,uh but lets talk about this wheres the grapes cakes
15117,actually, mm, yeah
15118,  almost every morning when i come down into my office he is on, too much going on i guess, right
15119,top of one of my other dolls, oh, hesitantly yes
15120, laughs okay, and probably, its purple taste
15121,  he has also pushed things off the shelf and has made strange, getting laid, right
15122,laughing sounds when im not in the room, yeah bro, theres really not a good middle ground of both grapes is there
15123, no and also  made strange laughing sounds is maybe the wildest, really, itd be good grapes is good though actually travis im coming
15124,way of saying  laughs, laughs,back around love local fresh grapes
15125, like were justokay not an efficiency of language  i honestly, thats probably it, but they dontbut theyre not making cakes of this stuff
15126,dont think my other spirits like him very much, okay, theyre making cakes of virtually every other flavor right
15127,  i just need to be honest about that, that was me, ive had so manyive had more lemon cakes than you could
15128,  i honestly dont think my other spirits like him very much i just, i saved it,shake a freaking stick at but ive never even
15129,need to be honest about that, cause i wanted to frame justin but then he instantly was like  it, and ive seen a lot of shows where they maketheyre makin stuff
15130,  i gotta get this off my chest yeah he seems like kind of a,wasnt me and can we go back and pretend it was justin for a while and,like this
15131,predator i dont really enjoy bumbum and i can see trisha doesnt either,do some jaccusing, but nobodys
15132, im guessing that if you had time to spend with him and figure out what the, next time next time whimsical voice next time two of us will, but wheres my grape british brake off my grape british brake
15133,backstory of the spirit that resides in him is then he probably would settle,grip it and rip it and it will be up to the audience to decide,off
15134,down and act better yeah trisha it sounds like youre taking some pretty, yeah, let mefuck my grape british bake off where is it
15135,fucking big logical leaps to get this thing out of your house huh, whimsical voice its me riddle m pissworth, right
15136, a great friend  at this time i have too many dolls and cannot, whimsical voice but i paid you to be here, its
15137,spend enough time with all of them i hear that though i hear that thats, did you head that riddle m pissworth they finally chose me, its also entirely possible that alex included at some point in the
15138,a toughthats a tough scenario  most of these dolls do not need so much, uhhuh,recipe so at some point youre gonna have to cook these grapes and
15139,attention but for him to settle down he will need it handle with care, mmhm,then she was like i gotta warn people about what theyre getting into
15140, and then it has a thing about yknow, oh,before
15141,  this is fake bullshit, now youre hoping that a real bird box doesnt happen, this is a sin against god i gotta give them a heads up before
15142,now heres whats up 1750 let me go ahead and crank 20 dollars down, no if terrace house were to really happen that would be so,they start mixin flour and whathaveyou

17140, yeah weve also covered food train wouldokay food train if, im assuming, ive gottrav ive gotten laid before and wanted to do a awful
17141,you are not aware of the deep lore food train is an innovation where all the, im assuming through context clues that you were not in the bed,waffle immediately after
17142,worlds foodor no sorry all the nations food,like you were maybe like watching tv or playing video games or like, which my sexual partner was not into and so i had to quell those
17143,  would be on a single train that would be like a roving food truck,sitting at your computer and they napped to be in the room with you,dark urges back inside and write them down holding back laughter in my
17144,that could move along and expand or retract capacity as needed, i do like the question  how do i wake them up that one seems,sex journal
17145, and crucially it was staffed by sexy robots,pretty easy to answer maybe a poke or a shake one of those two, speaking of sex journals should we go to the money zone
17146, whose bodies are for crosstalk, laughing, mm
17147, yeah whose bodies were grills and they all look like mark ruffalo, a kiss of breeze, do you think they tried to call the business money but then they

17149, laughs the sexy ruffalo bots and everybody wanted to get on the, oh no, oh shit
17150,train because it looks so sexy and hot would we be as a nation in a, what its cooking the bird is cooking this is incredible, wait who ripped it and grip
17151,better through laughter or worse scenario if the nation had heeded our, yeah oh its all about the notes the bird doesnt play, oh well i dont care if travis does it
17152,warnings about food train some three years ago or however long ago that, oh really, okay
17153,was when we sort of breathed that into existence, okay, that would be funny
17154, oh like seabiscuit fixed all of us that kind of thing, yeah, yeah maybe next time
17155, thank you we did we did fix seabiscuit, i mean even if its just like unintentional spooning right, why do you keeptravis travis travis
17156, actually i think wegriffin i hate to sort of tone police you i, yeah, where does that voicewhat partwhere does that voice deep
17157,think were switching back to popular i think were gonna stop laughs, yknow what maybemaybe go sleep in their bed,inside of you
17158,calling videos and stuff viral and think were just gonna start, and then just switch rooms, its like the third time riddle me piss guy showed up this episode
17159,  calling that popular again, you can socially distance the jog,and i wish he wouldheres the door dont let it hit you
17160, i tried to convince my kids that that was the case laughs they, ohh uhhuh uhhuh, yeah get out of here riddle m pissworth i dont want you i
17161,just werent buying it, thatsno thats gonna throw off,want travis
17162, laughs, but heres the thing  unless the answer to that is 8:15 its gone, we love travis we love travis i hate you
17163, can i tell you guys thethe troubling thing about some of these,on too long, yes
17164,ideas that we tend to throw out there, thats must see tv right there, yes
17165, no its that i now have this bad part of my brain thats like, right oh my god thats exactly what i was about to say laughs, wait what
17166, what the fuck else are they doing you know, no nobodys doing shit, whoa justin did
17167, like we can getive been thinking like  is this the moment that, oh yeah thats where you get like the wheels cross across like, no hold on why did you just confuse netflix and taco bell son
17168,we should try to getlike bag some big celebs,yknow the grates and you get that sings a funky beat bum bum tss, it is wild and i hope if this ispast is prologue vis a vis netflixs
17169, like business is usual for us exceptif i can find a time to keep,bum bumbumbum batss as the cars drive by yknow,programming i sure hope we dont hiti sure hope we dont get a bird box
17170,coming down here and doing this but like i know a lot of hollywood and, you get it, but a terrace house would be fantastic
17171,tv are sort of in uh suspension right now we had a couple projects kind of, bum bum tss bum bumbumbum batss, that would be exciting
17172,thrown into disarray by this so we are speaking from somea reasonably, rhythmically umbrella umbrella umbrella umbrella umbrella, instead of a bird box i would rather we all do a to all the boys
17173,educated stance here should we try to bag some big ones,umbrella umbrella umbrella,ive loved before is where i would rather be
17174, no the richard geres good trav lets talk about that for a, rhythmically hes bleeding hes bleeding its everywhere, thats the world i wanna live in
17175,second cause what i like about that is extremely difficult to attain and i, sings there goes the baker with his tray like always, justin can you make them do boss baby world
17176,think also my best guess would be a very bad match for the energy in this, the baguettes, okay
17177,program, oh is it spelled funny, hello
17178, so between those two i think that thats an interesting submission, oh, but i thought you said

17194,listen theive seen some of our celebrities alreadylisten everybody,the problem is society has turned their back on them im thinking mostly of, thats not three things

17466,content the tiktok community is celebrated for which i would assume is,hands wherever you are,bit of a howto like a funny joke and animation and loving that but like
17467,much less triplelupa focused now than it wouldve been two weeks ago, and in a wavy voice eeeneeergyyy,also maybe theres something you can take away there that would be

17503,bread please, the fact that,would like keep his mouth shut because he knows how many people out
17504, justwhatever conflagration of that whatever different, the fact of the matter is there aretheres like nothingno food,there love and respect kid rock but
17505,permutations you have,stuff that i just like will absolutely not eat like if other people eat it, he could be listening but now ive been emboldened by this tough
17506, of meat and bread,somewhere chances are ill eat it but there are plenty of things that if you,time ive been sharpened and honed like a katana or something and ill
17507, a conflagration is actually a fire but that actually is applicable i,like give me the option that id be like  oh id rather have that than that,just say that kid rock sucks shit and hes a nasty man
17508,think,like yknow what i mean, um i have a yahoo here and its part of a beautiful trend of
17509, in ourour situation, oh,yahoos that ive been noticing since people have been sending it in a lot of
17510,anyway this has been my brother my brother and me we hope youve, ooh,people sent this one in as well and it is um it is yahoos that have been
17511,enjoyed yourself we hope that we couldwill continue to provide a little bit, yeah,sent in during the during times uh this one is from march 20 th so i think
17512,of cheeriness for you, or potentially your husband also doesnt enjoy carrots and was,we can safely consider that the during times uh and its dylan and dylan
17513, yeah,making them thinking you enjoyed them,asks  my dad bought the nasty hamburger buns
17514, were just like everybody were fucking flying by the seat of our, think of all the money we couldve saved on carrots, so like everybody is suffering from this in their own ways some
17515,pants right now well fyou know itslike things arewere adjusting, no,like much much worse and much more serious than others and we would
17516,like we normally record on wednesdays and publish on mondays it seems, theres nothing that compares to corn like you cant be like corn,encourage you to find ways to support the people out there who really need
17517,like things are so drastically different even in like a fourday timespan,and now heres some lettuce now heres a like if you go carrot you can,your help but the good news is that none of those people are on yahoo
17518,but you know i reallywere gonna get through this like weve been,go carrot to celery easy,answers because
17519,doing this show for almost 10 years thats likeif we can do this show for, im sayingokay that was good im saying i think your husband, dylan says  my dad bought the nasty hamburger buns i hate
17520,10 years you know,overreacted laughs,when he does this
17521, im just saying it doesnt feelim just saying like the time shall, huh, laughs  i hate when he does this when he grills hamburgers
17522,pass and we willwe will figure out a new way of being is what im saying, theres a logic puzzle in there right thats like,theres a specific type of buns i like him to buy they are small light buns
17523, i mean i would hope were out of the worst of this show, theres a puddle of water on the ground and a man is dead, i like the way hes put in commas here because it says  they are
17524, yeah,laughing what happened,small comma  light comma  buns comma  these buns are buns
17525, yeah yes do that i guess just be a good citizen, no nooo,since the burgers are never too big they get smaller when you cook them
17526, uh, huh,thats just burger physiology
17527, and heres what i wouldheres what i wouldheres one more, would it kill you,uh  he bought the freaking big dark buns the bun is bigger than the
17528,thing i would say yourethis is just advice from somebody whos lived, okay,entire patty which means when i bite i will be biting into the bun and its
17529,with anxiety for basically his whole life do your best to accept your scenario, well well not lethal isnt the same as because i think what,dark which i dont like the dark buns he buys what should i do
17530,as it changes you know,youre also assuming there is a lot of damage will be done but now youve,ohh man ohh jeeze i mean
17531,like do your best to uh just embrace where youre at and be in that,figured out you need to roll your window up because then there are other, i think its important to be um yknow not necessarily
17532,moment and dont let yourself get too far ahead cause theres no way of,steps down and i feel like maybe if you get blasted in every step of the,conservative but like thoughtful about the food that you have and um the
17533,knowing you know we got today so focus on today and really you know,way it compounds the damage,food that is able to be circulated among the community um but at the
17534,what really seriously look at look at your situation and say  how could, yeah yeah yeah youre definitelyyoure bloodied yknow what i,same time biting into a big burger and gettingand wheres the beef like
17535,the mcelroy brothers address this i need advice about the new nuance,mean like oh no why didnt you roll your window up after you were,oh man is there anything fucking worse than that
17536,the new meaningless things the new meaningless conflicts in my life and,sprayed by the high powered foamy water, i brought home a big pack of uh uncle bens dirty rice an instant
17537,we will continue to address those, in a weird way i mean you can push on a car harder than you,pack and rachel was like  what the fuck and i was like  yeah man
17538,because this is gonna be weird because a lot of us are gonna have a lot of,can push on a person justin,maybe were a dirty rice family now
17539,the same meaningless conflicts in our life, well,  maybe were gonna have a season of jambalaya and that is how
17540, the same meaningless challenges the same easilyovercome, no i agree with you jman that they did not design them to,we will look back on this but the big buns guys is there anything we can
17541,challenges that we can all sort of talk about and work through together so,squish a person but im saying,do obviously we can cut the buns but then the edges arent
17542,you know let us know how we can help and well continue to be there to, yeah, the daddy cant make bigger meat the daddy knows how to make
17543,advise through these challenging days until, okay i dont think the foam rollers are gonna kill you,one type of burger its like you cant you cant you cant unprogram
17544, laughs well do either, i think that theyre gonna be unpleasant,that
17545, i think it might go, yes, travvy like a slider
17546,  something like this, and its like a cat of a billion tails that is going to like just rip the, when travis first went to applebees and they were like  hey
17547, my names justin mcelroy,flesh from bone,man we got sliders and he was like  whats sliders the show i love

17666,a careless person, like hiding inside, aw sure dude stanleyyy
17667, and i dont think this is the sort of person you trust with food, and yknow what maybe theres just a big bird that weve all been, stanleyyy
17668,hygiene,seeing a lot but like taking for granted right like there isits a new, danley uh fuckin dwight dude
17669, ione of twoim confused by another facet of this question,species of bird and weve all seen a bunch of them and everyones thought, pan fuckin jiiin
17670, the order was placed by susan  and maybe theres more clarity in, definitely someones categorized that bird right cataloged that bird, swights
17671,the question trav that you edited out but the order was placed by, and webut weve just been taking for granted that everyone, yeah
17672,susan was it for one meal for alex did alex have susan order one,knows that bird right, yeah
17673,discreet meal for them to enjoy because there is aweve added an, i thought that whilst on the joco cruise last year yknow wed sail, see thats where i went with it too and you know me i live in
17674,unnecessary middle man here a middle susan if you will into this process,past a tiny spit of land and your thought is like  definitely someone owns,austin and i havent been able to get out to all of my favorite yknow
17675,cause that is an order you could definitely have handled yourself,that land but what if they dont what if i was the first person to see that,cocktailrisseries uh some of my favorite uh mixing labs that a lot of the
17676, the alternative is susan was placing a bulk order laughing ,and its full of weird big birds that i could be riding on or talking to,mixologists out here have been whippin up for me what with their lavender
17677,and she showed up to her home to find a big hot stinky pile of, im just saying,smokes and scented orbs and shit like that and so i thought you were
17678,mediterranean food, i understood what you meant but it also sounded like a fun way of,giving me the hot new cocktail of the spring justin which is that you poured
17679, just uh on her stoop,saying you wanted to choke an ostrich,gin in a pan and make it get it hot and now were talking about hot gin
17680, weve allwere all concerned about our health right now but i, no weve talked about this for sure, burn all the alcohol out of that gin before i drink it i just want the

17682,folks if youre between 40 and 140 degrees that is the danger zone you do,of these isnt cataloged i got no fuckin clue, i just want that to burn me inside outside
17683,not leave food in that zone for more than four hours and then consume it, im just saying why has no one shown me these eight birds i, so that could be something by the way is this intro anything so
17684,and i cantive been runnin a lot of different simulations here in a program,dont feel like if eight birds exist wheres the proof yknow wheres,far cause weve tried about six different things in the format
17685,i have on my computer and ieven being generous and saying this is an,the proof, okay
17686,office where they have lunch at one and then susan got home by five its, no im just saying if theres more than eight birds i havent seen, or you just watched the sonic the hedgehog movie now on

18436,  well soon right though before the next new moon right, well perhaps then there was a time do you think there was a,one for theblaze one for the big dogg
18437, this is challenging,time where bees were like  listen if we poke people with our butts we die, now lets move on uh were all hurting for communication i
18438,  god its been so long,we all know that thats a scientific fact and so we have been reluctant to,think were all trying to reach out and touch souls whilst keeping our
18439, yeah please,sting people with our butts,human bodies six feet apart and that can be
18440, oh no hes about to do something bad isnt he,  but the time has come we need to start stinging people with our, that can beand butts and that can be tough and digital is

18442, oh so its twice as long,they did not leave us alone and we dont want to sting people with our,to each other and i think that thats important and i just wanted to share
18443, strained yeah,butts we dont want to,with you all this is hot off the presses this came in about 24 minutes ago
18444, uhh, now,on my phone and this was a text i got from a west virginia area code

18447, god disneyland disneyland sucks,  on our toast,yknow like thats a soul connection right there
18448, is that why you did this to give me an opportunity to say, but im saying like what if somebody did that what if i was, go herd and like bleed green and like pepperoni rolls and like
18449,disneyland sucks,making a sandwich and a giant said  okay great and peeled up my roof,jim justice right so like i know that we have that in common and
18450, only,and scraped that sandwich out of my house to eat it on his bigger sandwich,anyway they texted me and it looks like 19 friends that also are in the 304
18451, yeah disneyland is uh, well laughs listen we dont need to carry it that far i dont,area code and have sequential phone numbers which is a fuckin wild
18452, its pretty good if you can get past the feral cats, i dont understand why we need to go that far with the metaphor,coincidence but i feel the soul connection with all of them and they did say
18453, i heard its not even open,im just saying i work hard to make a sandwich,in this text message and there is a link here i havent clicked on it yet
18454, yeah i bet theyre having a fuckin hay day by the way 200 feral, listen justin we dont have towe dont have to carry the, but the text message says uh  see my juicy cream pie and then

18551, worth it, im just saying its alreadyits hard enough to wrap my mind, struggling through laughter i just need to talk to someone

20604, would it still be drivable and then you like thought about it and,,kinds of just sort of big cat designs uh and
20605,then i would say  ah the correct answer is i dont have a buick and its,, yeah probably from the same company

20753,guys i feel like pickles more than i mean literally any food pickles are,, almost

20769,rick is not in the new tony hawk remake just 100 right there right,,  oh no i should stay away i think in most situations  and
20770,now,,maybe this is why hippos are dangerous is that they just always have the
20771, definitely happening,,thought in their mind of like  i got this im so big
20772, oh yeah yeah yeah,, yeah
20773, for sure for sure for sure pickle rick baby yoda um i dont know,, um apparently hippo skin is very thick and quote  resistant to

20782, thats why they have the fuckin ear piece in,, oh my god
20783, you never noticed that they got a ear piece every surgeon has,, laughs
20784,and then they got atheres a boss surgeon telling them the different,, holy shit
20785,things they have to do and occasionally ribbled jokes,, laughs if hes been dead for seven years technically i think you

20799,better than like you wouldve done it at home like its definitely better,,besmirch this dudes name but if you do plant the five dollar mcdonalds gift
20800,than that i did a better job than you wouldve done,,card in his desk its gonna be a confusing clue but the police i think
20801, sure i guess,,any detective worth their salt is gonna find that and yknow figure out the
20802, no but,,frame that youre putting together here
20803, i want to talk about this,, ooh i got a good idea that excites me on a very personal level
20804, the first timei think basically the way it works is like this you,,uh you should email your teacher and be like  oh thats great ive
20805,have a big doctor and theres a little doctor,,actually done a few edits to theto my uh to that draft and
20806, and at first the little doctor is like standing on the big doctors,,  yeah and i think itd be honestly pretty fucked up for you to put
20807,feet and the big doctor is holding their hands and doing all the cutting for,,out my first draft of it and heres a new version of it and your new version
20808,them right,,of it could be a completely different thing now what excites me is i would
20809, and then they keep doing surgery after surgery and then um then,,looove to take another pass at grant andrews kid cop ive had some ideas
20810,just one time they like look behind them and they realize that the big,,about grant andrews kid cop that i think could really flesh out the lore i
20811,doctor is now um in the bathroom,,would probably remove all of the references to jet moto a very unsuccessful
20812, they slipped away in the night,,playstation 1 era racing game that one can probably hit the bricks
20813, youre the doctor now they were never alive they were actually a,,this is gonna get you out of the scrape but its also gonna allow you to
20814,ghost,,punch up your work although actually your work was stolen so you will
20815, in this one in this one they were a ghost but like thats a basic,,maybe make it worse
20816,idea,, uh i want to thank john roderick and the long winters for the use
20817, its basically like a like the bicycle like learning to ride a bike,,of our theme song its a departure off the album putting the days to bed
20818,like the big doctor is holding your waist and then you are doing the entire,,which you can go listen to at any time and no one can stop you and uhh
20819,surgery and realize like they let go already and youre just like still doing,,also maxipum fun laughs
20820,it,, maxipum fun
20821, oh my god,, yeah well unpack that later
20822, sure,, uh i would love to read a final yahoo but i have just actually
20823, listen were not doctors we have to make our money the honest,,found a link to a recipe recreating the dennys hooburrito experience
20824,way around here we cant rely on big podcasters,, i wishcan i just read that like i could take a pass at just
20825, okay thats interesting oh you handed me a business card here,,reading that and seeing like
20826,yep thats what it says podcast doctor thats a little bizarre,, okay so youre gonna need a half cup of chicken breast and

20871,arbys is testing an advertising approach designed for mature audiences,,themselves and that makes them horny or something like that and then
20872,  the quick service chain is once again tapping the star power of,,they take it back to the hive and they vibrates so violently and it makes all
20873,rb crooner barry white,,the pollen go off and then the queen eats it
20874,  only this time as a new character that the company refers to as,, uh to make honey out of her butt
20875,appetite man,, uh i think that down to beezness recommends a sort of like
20876,  aimed at touting the crave appeal of the chains menu arbys,,shedding like a vibrating and getting off complacency
20877,created  see these days we say cravability thats how far weve come in,, they cant theyre too little
20878,these 19 years  arbys created a character it thought would represent how,, right
20879,passionate seductive and discriminating a persons appetite might be,, youre gonna get stung
20880,i know what youre saying is this the same person thats driving into,, they need it
20881,arbys and the answer is yes it is  the appetite urges you to act on your,, its a trap its a
20882,real desires and not settle for ordinary fast food because your appetite,, it is to justins point a literal honey pot
20883,wants the best,, yes um
20884,they dont finish the sentence but im assuming it ends with thing that is,, heres the thing
20885,available at arbys the best thing that they have on the menu of arbys,, were so far from it
20886, so what better personification of what the company refers to as quote,, were so far from it arent we were so far
20887,passion love and seduction than mr white the singer was also a natural,, the metaphor has poisoned this episode so far this is all im
20888,choice since the company already had good results using him in its 99,,saying
20889,campaign,, shit is shit is changing right now shit is revolutionary and its
20890,this is fucking so wild that someones like three years after the fact like,,important to get in there its important to march support black lives

20905,sandwiches,,fucking unthinkable
20906,  in the commercials the soul singer invades peoples lives with the,, the emotional toll that goes into slogan generation is like not
20907,pavlovian timing to personify their hunger pangs first as a voice then,,repeatable we almost didnt survive the first time i think

21236,cause you thought it looked rad my actual one that im gonna sneak in,, i do think slugs are the worst and im wondering i think it might
21237,there is that maybe it was a nonny gift that is actually feeling kind of,,just be because the slug is naked and it looks like hes trying to be
21238,powerful to me now that i say it out loud how did the tiger blanket arrive,,salacious a little bit whereas a snail
21239,into our lives,, slug yeah the name slug is bad but
21240, ah,, its got ugh right in there and honestly the slug i feel like
21241, yes,,theres just more touchable surface on it that i dont want and a snail is
21242, you burned it and then you had to buy a new one cause you were,,like  i could pick that up and have it not ruin my day but the slug
21243,afraid shed find out,,fucking no way forget about it
21244, one time nonny sent us lunch meat coasters i feel like weve,, hey where do they get those fuckin shells though

21250,they did,,brother i got it from here ill get this shell home do you know what i

21391,way to remember that there was one point when people had i think we will,,
21392,all agree too much money yknow what i mean,,
21393, like they just had too much money so this kind of fixed that a,,
21394,little bit made them have less yknow what i mean,,

21414, when i was in third grade my school held a writing competition i,,
21415,submitted a story and it was one of the winners i got a five dollar,,
21416,mcdonalds gift card and that was the last i thought of it until recently,,
21417,when my old elementary school announced that theyd be releasing a book,,
21418,of all the stories that had won the competition as a way to look fondly on,,
21419,prequarantine times the problem is i plagiarized my story from an,,
21420,encyclopedia brown book,,
21421,  i changed the names of the characters but it was still otherwise,,

21476, whoa okay,,
21477, okay,,
21478, first i have two complicating factors of this,,
21479, the first is that uhh i hate to rename the tour this late into the,,
21480,year,,
21481, tickets,,
21482, just hate to rename it laughs this point,,
21483, for sure for sure thats huge uh uh number two is do you,,
21484,remember when all the beeznesses had to shut down and a lot of them are,,
21485,still shut down thats tonally for me bumping,,
21486, you wont,,
21487, mmm,,
21488, youve complicatedyouve complicated this because bees i,,
21489,think at some points it would be beneficial for them to rest on laurels just,,
21490,so the various pollination things that need to happen,,
21491, do you know what i mean like resting on laurels occasionally for,,
21492,them is probably essential so they probably do rest on laurels,,
21493, thats absolutely wild travis the thing youve said to me that,,
21494,theyre minding their own business is absolutely wild these monstrous,,
21495,things are flying around fucking plants and stinging toddlers every single,,
21496,day it is what they are known for theyre making movies about it they,,
21497,crave it they crave interaction with us,,
21498, they love interfacing with humans so much they made their jizz,,
21499,taste good come on now,,
21500, they do not mind their own business,,
21501, thank you,,
21502, right,,
21503, okay you did not address any of my salient points and this is,,
21504,classic classic oratory style from you travis to think that you can get away,,
21505,with this laughs because you have not addressed my uh chief,,
21506,complaints they are totally in our beezness,,
21507, okay,,
21508, thank you,,
21509, and this is a sandwich that you have made from your own jizz,,
21510, you nasty nasty boy,,
21511, you have to work hard if youre gonna make a jizz sandwich cant,,
21512,work soft no way,,
21513, yeah,,
21514, i just want toi dont understand the way this works where if we,,
21515,have settled on a theme for the year,,
21516, um and weand two of you say  lets change it is that just it,,
21517,is it a majority vote or is this like,,
21518, cause it does raise the question if we have the ability to do this it,,
21519,does raise the question of 2016 we had a cherry seven weeks there at the,,
21520,tail end where we couldve been like  listen these bridges aint gettin,,
21521,built,,
21522,  no twenty fixteen were changing it to twenty sucksteen,,
21523, yeah,,
21524, no absolutely not,,
21525, i will grant you this the speed at which things seem to be moving,,
21526, currently,,
21527, does make the idea that we could sort of encapsulate 12 months,,
21528,of existence on this particular plane,,
21529, unthinkable,,
21530, thethethethe height of hubris honestly,,
21531, do you know how wild it is to liveif youdo you know how wild it,,
21532,is that there have been several times in the past week to ten days where,,
21533,ive been talking to someone and been like  oh right theres a global,,
21534,pandemic thats shutting shit  like ei have to remember about how the,,
21535,planet is sick,,
21536, wild wild times are we doing this i mean are we doing this im,,
21537,into it if you guys are but like i want to make sure that this isyou cant,,
21538,walk it back cause what i dont want is pelike ive always felt pretty,,
21539,good about punxsutawney phil style we make the call thats the call,,
21540, and no one else gets to weigh in on it i dont want people to think,,
21541,that this is a a sort of yknow submit ticket and well review it to see if,,
21542,we change the year,,
21543, specials a fuckin word for it,,
21544, we shit our pants on this one,,
21545, imwewe are now so consistent at getting it wrong that im,,
21546,starting to think next year we should title it  watch your house burn down,,
21547,as your infant daughter cries,,
21548, and that way that wont happen to anybody,,
21549, like that will guaranteed not happen,,

21816,  in another 2d game that same superstar character  a strawberry,,
21817,with a dashing smile  rides a booster juice cup like a rocket with fruits,,
21818,firing out instead of flames he flies through the skies avoiding evil candy,,
21819,collecting tasty fruit and racking up the points,,
21820, im not making this next part up,,
21821,  the third game unravels a darker more riveting plot involving the,,
21822,destiny of the strawberry,,
21823,  this is a uniquely styled intense game with challenges above and,,
21824,below laughing,,
21825, in fuckin heaven and hell i guess it means,,
21826,  with challenges above and below where the player has to double,,
21827,tap to slip in between terrifying blenders in these vibrantly drawn worlds,,
21828,players must use a variety of skills to survive and gain points,,
21829, this reads like the person writing it was being told about the,,
21830,existence of video games via telegraph through time travel like they were,,
21831,just getting bleeps and bloops of a portal opening and closing,,
21832, additional games were also designed to challenge your mind these puzzles,,
21833,are formulated to make you think as you match fruit and test your reflexes,,
21834,certainly the gameplay experience is enhanced while sipping one of booster,,
21835,juices delicious smoothies,,
21836, yeah so anyway,,
21837, 2016 it may still be there,,
21838, yeah id love that griff,,
21839, is a snail a slug,,
21840, no,,
21841, i feel,,
21842, i feel like theyre different i feel like snails have little suction cups,,
21843,at the bottom of them and slugs dont that is mythat is my,,
21844, and i think that theyre probably very closely related and i bet if,,
21845,a slug sees a snail hes like  aw shit that looks nice,,
21846,  that fuckin looks nice id love that when salt starts pouring down,,
21847,on me,,
21848, uh obviously,,
21849, yeah but when the salt starts flyin,,
21850, who looks like a smart aleck now,,
21851, hmm,,
21852, yeah,,
21853, who brought the first shell,,
21854, of course,,
21855, i wish there was some way to find this information,,
21856, its soits so hard,,
21857, no youre not getgoodont search this i dont want the,,
21858,answer,,
21859, if anyone ever tweets at me about the reality about snails like if,,
21860,youre sitting at home like  oh im getting so mad i know this dont tell,,
21861,me i dont want to know i want to live in ignorance about this one,,
21862,let me have this little bit of magic alright please,,
21863, are they all rentals maybe,,
21864, do you rent them at the shell store and then you keep them as,,
21865,long as you want,,
21866, and then once theyre worn out you take them back in and get a,,
21867,brand new shell,,
21868, no that implies that they could own them at a certain point,,
21869, what is the difference between renting and leasing i actually dont,,
21870,know this dont tell me,,
